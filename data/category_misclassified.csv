		 Subject: MEMO TO FILE: Wisvest Discussions and Ecogas SA

On Friday, August 4 JB and I had a discussion re: engaging Wisvest in a 
dialogue to resolve some of the major issues around the San Antonio project.  
In that discussion I reiterated what was discussed at the 8/2/00 Board 
meeting which was:  a) we needed to finalize the numbers re: the WMI royalty 
renegotiation; b) verify the expected EPC costs to complete the project; c) 
revise the project pro-forma to reflect the revisions in (a) and (b) and d) 
run sensitivity analyses on the level of subordination Wisvest would have to 
accept in order to make the project economics viable.  In our phone 
conversation on 8/4/00 we again agreed this was the right course of action to 
take.  Subsequent to that call, JB had conversations w/ Derek Price at 
Wisvest re: prospective meeting dates and exchanging various info re: the 
project.  In another phone conversation on Monday, August 7, I specifically 
asked JB whether he had sent the project pro-formas and/or other proprietary 
info to Derek Price to which JB responded ""no.""  He said he ""... sent him 
summary info ... but did NOT send him the pro-forma ...""  I then asked him to 
forward to me copies of everything he had sent to Derek.  What he sent to me 
was some very basic e-mails and financial summary info.  I also asked Derek 
to forward to me everything JB had sent to him and I got a whole lot more, 
including the full-blown project model/pro-forma.  This has seriously 
diminished all of our negotiating leverage!

On 8/10/00, I became aware of some efforts that appear to involve JB in 
setting up a South American version of Ecogas (Ecogas S.A.) and called him to 
inquire as to what was going on.  In our phone conversation JB explicitly 
denied ""any involvement"" including any ""ownership"" in such an enterprise.  I 
also asked JB to forward to me by Friday, 8/11/00, copies of any and all 
documents, agreements, etc... relating to Ecogas S.A.  To date he has sent me 
nothing but an undated DRAFT MOU as well as some misc and meaningless 
correspondence (undated and/or old e-mails, etc...).  None of the info sent 
is what I asked for on August 4 (complete execution copies of the MOU 
regarding Ecogas S.A. including ownership interests, etc... as well as copies 
of Articles of Incorporation for Ecogas S.A., etc...Who is Ecogas S.A.?  
Where is it currently incorporated?  Who are the beneficial owners?  Under 
what authority are you transacting business (what is your title, etc...)  JB 
continues to reference ""nothing has been signed, incorporated, etc..."" - then 
why is JB's signature evidenced on an ""Amendment"" to the ""Memorandum of 
Understanding:  Ecogas S.A. - Tortola/JCS""?  

JB referenced the need to ""directing our efforts to resolution of the crisis, 
rather than continuing personal distractions and devisiveness.""  For the past 
couple of months he has been asked to generate cash by selling assets, 
greenhouse gas emission credits, etc...  To the best of my knowledge Ecogas 
has yet to see one penny!

As always there seems to be a direct contradiction between the ""stories"" and 
the facts!

Our contract with IGS provides that for any agreement identified by IGS and 
executed, TW will pay a one-time incentive fee of 3% of the first $15 million 
of net present value, 2% of the next $10 million of net present value, etc.

The Southern contract associated with the Gallup Expansion is at a rate of 
$0.205 for 25,000 Dth/d for 5 years.  Using a discount factor of 15%, the net 
present value of the contract is $6,270,625, so IGS's commission would be 
$188,118.75.  Since the contract does not specify how NPV will be calculated 
(I believe we purposely omitted this for whatever reason), we will need to 
agree on a rate that is fair given the nature of and risk associated with the 
project.  We should probably use whatever is standard in the industry for 
this type of project, if that's possible to determine.  I have a call in to 
James Centilli for his recommendation in this regard, and will let you know

We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:

Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
Lloyd Will for East Power
Geof Storey for Gas 
Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net
Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys
Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.

Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.

I am assuming its zero at the moment.

Note new cost limits for building laterals within our existing blanket 
authorization (i.e., without seeking a specific certificate).  The $$ is 
probably still not high enough to give us ability to build the whole project, 
but it may give us some flexibility.  Thanks MKM.  
Also, has any one heard from Tino or Dennis in the last week or so?  I left 
Tino some voicemails on a question he had left for me, and the name of the

follow-up meeting with them to talk about turbine availability and regulatory 
options, etc? DF

Hello!

Here is the latest draft on Garden State/Project Barbed Wire.  As I mentioned 
to Dee, the agreement is due to be signed on Tuesday, 7/11.

Dee/Rick, I just learned that there are multi-employer plans for the 
unionized employees.   I'll provide details as I learn them.

I guess you can forward your comments to me, with a copy to Stuart Zisman.

Thanks.  Michelle

Natural Gas Futures End Choppy Day Down

     Natural gas for March delivery on the NYMEX ended down $0.021
yesterday at $2.117 per MMBtu. The April contract slipped $0.014 to $2.184
per MMBtu. The market opened lower, but bounced off $2.08. However, it
could not get higher than $2.15, and failed to trigger anticipated buy
stops above $2.17. Every rally is hit with a wave of selling. Look for the
market to open lower again this morning. The AGA reports last week's
storage information tomorrow afternoon. Expect a withdrawal of about 120
Bcf - 130 Bcf. Last week, 111 Bcf was withdrawn leaving 2.294 Tcf in
storage. The nation's storage facilities are still 70% full compared to
38% full a year ago. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and
Canada was generally flat to plus or minus $0.05 yesterday. Physical
prices jumped higher in the Northeast. Utilities reportedly nominated
base-loads for every day for February, intending to use the spot market
only as weather dictates. Cash prices held as much as $0.08 - $0.09 above
the NYMEX. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub ended flat
at $2.18 per MMBtu.

WSJ Says Enron Officials Knew About Chewco Partnership

     Top Enron executives, including Chairman Lay and former CEO Jeffrey
Skilling, knew about the controversial partnerships, according to the Wall
Street Journal, citing minutes from a November 5, 1997 meeting. Former CFO
Andrew Fastow and several board members including external director
Herbert Winokur Jr were also at the meeting that discussed Enron's
partnership Chewco, named for the Star Wars character Chewbacca. Chewco,
which was supposed to be completely independent, but was run and partly
owned by Enron executive Michael Kopper, who also attended the meeting.
Federal investigators and private litigants are trying to find out who
knew what about Chewco and when. An attorney for Winokur says the
executive committee was told that Chewco was a special-purpose vehicle not
affiliated with the company. The board never waived the
conflict-of-interest policy for Kopper nor was the board told that Kopper
was involved with Chewco.

Lay Breaks Date with Congress After Report Issued


    Enron attempted to systematically manipulate its financial results and
deceive shareholders as top executives made personal gains of millions of
dollars, according to William Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law
School in testimony to be delivered before Congress yesterday. There was
also failures in the performance of Enron's outside advisors. And there
was a fundamental default of leadership and management, starting with
former CEO Ken Lay and reaching to the board and senior managers. As
Congress begins a week of hearings, the House Financial Services capital
markets subcommittee also heard from SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt. Powers
joined the Enron board to investigate events leading up to the company
filing for bankruptcy on December 2nd. He has issued a 218-page report
that found Enron fattened its profits by almost $1 billion through a web
of financial partnerships used to hide losses, while top managers made
millions of dollars they should never have received. He laid some of the
blame for on Lay and of Jeffrey Skilling. Powers said former ex-Enron CFO
Andrew Fastow made at least $30 million, while former senior executive
Michael Kopper made at least $10 million through their involvement in
off-the-books partnerships. Enron's board of directors failed in its duty
to provide leadership and oversight and in the end, the tragedy could and
should have been avoided, Powers said. After the report was released, Lay
canceled plans to testify before a Senate committee and before the capital
markets subcommittee.

AEP May Sell Some Foreign Assets


    American Electric Power may sell Seeboard, which serves 2 million
power and natural gas users in the UK, and CitiPower, an Australian retail
and distribution unit, to lower debt as it switches its focus to wholesale
markets and away from household power supply. Like Reliant and Mirant, AEP
is selling foreign assets to protect its credit ratings. Enron's
bankruptcy has caused many energy companies to slash capital spending and
sell assets to lower debt. AEP has $2.6 billion in debt maturing in the
next 2 years. Seeboard is valued at about $2.1 billion and CitiPower at as
much as $760 million. AEP, which acquired Seeboard in a $10 billion buyout
of C&SW, said will consider all potential options for Seeboard. AEP's 4th
quarter earnings fell 41% due to mild weather. It is selling common stock
and convertible preferred shares to raise cash and shore up its balance
sheet. Last year, AEP sold Yorkshire Power in the UK and purchased 2 power
stations. AEP has also been expanding its energy trading business after
Enrons collapse. It bought Enron's Scandinavian businesses and hired 22
coal traders from Enron. Seeboard is likely to fetch a good price since it
is the only supply business for sale in the UK. E.ON, Electricite de
France and Scottish & Southern Energy have been named as likely bidders
for Seeboard. CitiPowers sale will probably happen in the 3rd quarter,
according to AEP. Possible buyers could be Australian Gas Light, United
Energy and Origin Energy. AEP bought the retail and distribution company
for $1.1 billion in 1998.

Williams May Sell Midwest Oil Products Pipeline


    Williams may sell its 8,000-mile Midwest oil products pipeline and
storage depots for between $500 million and $1.5 billion, to help defray
costs from possible exposure to $2.4 billion from Williams Communications.
Last week, Williams postponed the release of 4th quarter results to review
costs associated with Williams Communications Group, which was spun off in
April. Williams said that those costs will be included in the 4th quarter
earnings report. Williams Energy Partners which is 60% owned by Williams
has been mentioned as a likely buyer for the pipeline. Williams has sold
securities and cut capital spending to shore up its balance sheet amid
heavier scrutiny by credit rating agencies following Enron's bankruptcy.
Williams' 7.5% coupon bonds maturing in 2031 were down about $44 to $879
per $1,000 face value from $923 last week, with the spread above US
Treasuries climbing to 330 basis points from 285. None of the rating
agencies has downgraded Williams debt yet, but S&P has says it may lower
Williams' ratings because of concern about the company's finances. S&P
rates Williams 'BBB+', Moody's rates it 'Baa2' and Fitch rates it as
'BBB', all investment grade. Williams is aiming complete the Midwest
pipeline sale by the end of the 2nd quarter. Net income for Williams
Energy Partners more climbed to $21.7 million from $3 million a year ago.
It also  raised quarterly payment to unit holders by 12% to $0.59. The
possible purchase of the Midwest pipeline could be financed through a
combination of debt and equity, Williams Energy Partners said. The
partnership has $140 million in private debt. Williams said its 4th
quarter loss had widened and its banks have warned that the it may be in
default of their credit agreements. Williams' stock dropped 13.9%
yesterday, down 2.64 to 16.36.

Lay Makes Himself Scarce


    A congressional committee trying to serve a subpoena on former Enron
Chairman Ken Lay can not seem to locate him. His personal attorney does
not know where he is and would not accept the subpoena. The House of
Representatives Financial Services Committee finds the whole situation
quiet puzzling. Lay's attorney says he is ill and has no idea where Lay
is. Lay resigned from Enron's board yesterday as two congressional
committees vowed to force him to come before them to testify or take the
5th Amendment. He had been scheduled to appear before a House Financial
Services subcommittee, but backed out over the weekend. It had hoped to
compel him to appear today. Lay had also been scheduled to appear before a
Senate committee, but canceled that date also.

TRADERS DEBATE SHORT SIDE OF MARKET

   Although Monday's price action on the New York Mercantile Exchange is
perhaps best described as lackadaisical, some traders see inspiration to
take the short side of the market where others are focusing on a longer
term trend higher.  ""When the March contract expired (January 29), it got
as low as $1.97 and developed a modest countertrend higher. As long as the
market was able to continue trading above the previous day's low, that
advance worked well,"" noted Dean Hazelcorn, trader with Coquest, Dallas.
""Today looks like a sell signal. The high of the March contract did not
exceed Friday's high and today's low was lower. That sets up a trade down
to $1.97. I look for a slow deteriorating front end of the board,"" he
noted.  ""I'm back in a bearish mode, and I think we're headed below $2.00.
I believe that there is a 99% probability the market will work lower, but
it may take 3 months to do it,"" he cautioned.  Other traders are more
optimistic.  ""Longer term I'm bullish,"" says John Beaver, President
Private Futures Group, Oklahoma City.  ""It's more difficult to be bullish
on the front of the board, but looking at the charts it suggests that
prices may be set to rise.  There's a gap on the weekly chart between
$2.17 and $2.20 on the weekly chart (week ending January 18, and January
25). and if prices could fill that gap, it would be a positive sign that
prices were set to move higher,"" he said.  A gap is a pattern on the price
charts followed by market technicians. The idea is that the gap may act as
a barrier to (in this case) further price advances. Once the gap is
""filled"", however, a potential limitation to price advances has been
removed and prices would be empowered to move higher.  ""I don't have any
interest in being short the market at the $2.00 level. I don't want to be
in a trade that may only make 10 or 15 cents and have to worry about it,""
he said.  ""If you are a commercial trader are you going to get short at
$1.85? What is your board of directors going to say?""

Natural Gas Futures End Choppy Day Down

     Natural gas for March delivery on the NYMEX ended down $0.021
yesterday at $2.117 per MMBtu. The April contract slipped $0.014 to $2.184
per MMBtu. The market opened lower, but bounced off $2.08. However, it
could not get higher than $2.15, and failed to trigger anticipated buy
stops above $2.17. Every rally is hit with a wave of selling. Look for the
market to open lower again this morning. The AGA reports last week's
storage information tomorrow afternoon. Expect a withdrawal of about 120
Bcf - 130 Bcf. Last week, 111 Bcf was withdrawn leaving 2.294 Tcf in
storage. The nation's storage facilities are still 70% full compared to
38% full a year ago. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and
Canada was generally flat to plus or minus $0.05 yesterday. Physical
prices jumped higher in the Northeast. Utilities reportedly nominated
base-loads for every day for February, intending to use the spot market
only as weather dictates. Cash prices held as much as $0.08 - $0.09 above
the NYMEX. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub ended flat
at $2.18 per MMBtu.

WSJ Says Enron Officials Knew About Chewco Partnership

     Top Enron executives, including Chairman Lay and former CEO Jeffrey
Skilling, knew about the controversial partnerships, according to the Wall
Street Journal, citing minutes from a November 5, 1997 meeting. Former CFO
Andrew Fastow and several board members including external director
Herbert Winokur Jr were also at the meeting that discussed Enron's
partnership Chewco, named for the Star Wars character Chewbacca. Chewco,
which was supposed to be completely independent, but was run and partly
owned by Enron executive Michael Kopper, who also attended the meeting.
Federal investigators and private litigants are trying to find out who
knew what about Chewco and when. An attorney for Winokur says the
executive committee was told that Chewco was a special-purpose vehicle not
affiliated with the company. The board never waived the
conflict-of-interest policy for Kopper nor was the board told that Kopper
was involved with Chewco.

Lay Breaks Date with Congress After Report Issued


    Enron attempted to systematically manipulate its financial results and
deceive shareholders as top executives made personal gains of millions of
dollars, according to William Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law
School in testimony to be delivered before Congress yesterday. There was
also failures in the performance of Enron's outside advisors. And there
was a fundamental default of leadership and management, starting with
former CEO Ken Lay and reaching to the board and senior managers. As
Congress begins a week of hearings, the House Financial Services capital
markets subcommittee also heard from SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt. Powers
joined the Enron board to investigate events leading up to the company
filing for bankruptcy on December 2nd. He has issued a 218-page report
that found Enron fattened its profits by almost $1 billion through a web
of financial partnerships used to hide losses, while top managers made
millions of dollars they should never have received. He laid some of the
blame for on Lay and of Jeffrey Skilling. Powers said former ex-Enron CFO
Andrew Fastow made at least $30 million, while former senior executive
Michael Kopper made at least $10 million through their involvement in
off-the-books partnerships. Enron's board of directors failed in its duty
to provide leadership and oversight and in the end, the tragedy could and
should have been avoided, Powers said. After the report was released, Lay
canceled plans to testify before a Senate committee and before the capital
markets subcommittee.

AEP May Sell Some Foreign Assets


    American Electric Power may sell Seeboard, which serves 2 million
power and natural gas users in the UK, and CitiPower, an Australian retail
and distribution unit, to lower debt as it switches its focus to wholesale
markets and away from household power supply. Like Reliant and Mirant, AEP
is selling foreign assets to protect its credit ratings. Enron's
bankruptcy has caused many energy companies to slash capital spending and
sell assets to lower debt. AEP has $2.6 billion in debt maturing in the
next 2 years. Seeboard is valued at about $2.1 billion and CitiPower at as
much as $760 million. AEP, which acquired Seeboard in a $10 billion buyout
of C&SW, said will consider all potential options for Seeboard. AEP's 4th
quarter earnings fell 41% due to mild weather. It is selling common stock
and convertible preferred shares to raise cash and shore up its balance
sheet. Last year, AEP sold Yorkshire Power in the UK and purchased 2 power
stations. AEP has also been expanding its energy trading business after
Enrons collapse. It bought Enron's Scandinavian businesses and hired 22
coal traders from Enron. Seeboard is likely to fetch a good price since it
is the only supply business for sale in the UK. E.ON, Electricite de
France and Scottish & Southern Energy have been named as likely bidders
for Seeboard. CitiPowers sale will probably happen in the 3rd quarter,
according to AEP. Possible buyers could be Australian Gas Light, United
Energy and Origin Energy. AEP bought the retail and distribution company
for $1.1 billion in 1998.

Williams May Sell Midwest Oil Products Pipeline


    Williams may sell its 8,000-mile Midwest oil products pipeline and
storage depots for between $500 million and $1.5 billion, to help defray
costs from possible exposure to $2.4 billion from Williams Communications.
Last week, Williams postponed the release of 4th quarter results to review
costs associated with Williams Communications Group, which was spun off in
April. Williams said that those costs will be included in the 4th quarter
earnings report. Williams Energy Partners which is 60% owned by Williams
has been mentioned as a likely buyer for the pipeline. Williams has sold
securities and cut capital spending to shore up its balance sheet amid
heavier scrutiny by credit rating agencies following Enron's bankruptcy.
Williams' 7.5% coupon bonds maturing in 2031 were down about $44 to $879
per $1,000 face value from $923 last week, with the spread above US
Treasuries climbing to 330 basis points from 285. None of the rating
agencies has downgraded Williams debt yet, but S&P has says it may lower
Williams' ratings because of concern about the company's finances. S&P
rates Williams 'BBB+', Moody's rates it 'Baa2' and Fitch rates it as
'BBB', all investment grade. Williams is aiming complete the Midwest
pipeline sale by the end of the 2nd quarter. Net income for Williams
Energy Partners more climbed to $21.7 million from $3 million a year ago.
It also  raised quarterly payment to unit holders by 12% to $0.59. The
possible purchase of the Midwest pipeline could be financed through a
combination of debt and equity, Williams Energy Partners said. The
partnership has $140 million in private debt. Williams said its 4th
quarter loss had widened and its banks have warned that the it may be in
default of their credit agreements. Williams' stock dropped 13.9%
yesterday, down 2.64 to 16.36.

Lay Makes Himself Scarce


    A congressional committee trying to serve a subpoena on former Enron
Chairman Ken Lay can not seem to locate him. His personal attorney does
not know where he is and would not accept the subpoena. The House of
Representatives Financial Services Committee finds the whole situation
quiet puzzling. Lay's attorney says he is ill and has no idea where Lay
is. Lay resigned from Enron's board yesterday as two congressional
committees vowed to force him to come before them to testify or take the
5th Amendment. He had been scheduled to appear before a House Financial
Services subcommittee, but backed out over the weekend. It had hoped to
compel him to appear today. Lay had also been scheduled to appear before a
Senate committee, but canceled that date also.

TRADERS DEBATE SHORT SIDE OF MARKET

   Although Monday's price action on the New York Mercantile Exchange is
perhaps best described as lackadaisical, some traders see inspiration to
take the short side of the market where others are focusing on a longer
term trend higher.  ""When the March contract expired (January 29), it got
as low as $1.97 and developed a modest countertrend higher. As long as the
market was able to continue trading above the previous day's low, that
advance worked well,"" noted Dean Hazelcorn, trader with Coquest, Dallas.
""Today looks like a sell signal. The high of the March contract did not
exceed Friday's high and today's low was lower. That sets up a trade down
to $1.97. I look for a slow deteriorating front end of the board,"" he
noted.  ""I'm back in a bearish mode, and I think we're headed below $2.00.
I believe that there is a 99% probability the market will work lower, but
it may take 3 months to do it,"" he cautioned.  Other traders are more
optimistic.  ""Longer term I'm bullish,"" says John Beaver, President
Private Futures Group, Oklahoma City.  ""It's more difficult to be bullish
on the front of the board, but looking at the charts it suggests that
prices may be set to rise.  There's a gap on the weekly chart between
$2.17 and $2.20 on the weekly chart (week ending January 18, and January
25). and if prices could fill that gap, it would be a positive sign that
prices were set to move higher,"" he said.  A gap is a pattern on the price
charts followed by market technicians. The idea is that the gap may act as
a barrier to (in this case) further price advances. Once the gap is
""filled"", however, a potential limitation to price advances has been
removed and prices would be empowered to move higher.  ""I don't have any
interest in being short the market at the $2.00 level. I don't want to be
in a trade that may only make 10 or 15 cents and have to worry about it,""
he said.  ""If you are a commercial trader are you going to get short at
$1.85? What is your board of directors going to say?""

These guys don't give up.  I'll forward any information Tino gives me on 
their latest DOE strategy.  Rockey--do you have any interest in following up 
on Tino's Wichita project??  I don't know how far it is from any of our 
lines, but it may be worth a chat.  DF

Sorry you are feedling bad. Hope reading email doesn't hurt. I'll try and be 
brief. 
1. We have an opportunity to acquire a? 35MW? cogeneration facility in Kansas 
that is from the early 1980's and rarely used. We may want to talk about a? 
joint project. Can I borrow some expertise via a phone call fom you to your 
electric gurus to let me know what the spot market into KC and Wichita looks 
like.

2. I met with DML and we intend to propose a deal that has us charging only 
for the generation and for DOE to assumme the risk and or reward of the cost 
of gas.Before you have any conversations with Dennis or your folks give me a 
call so we can flesh this out. We have DOE meetings scheduled for 7/24-25th 
so it is a busy month. Our consultant's are reviewing the DOE data we? 
received. I''l let you? know what we learn.They may have a bigger steam load 
than I would have guessed.

FYI, Jim asked that I drop you a note with regard to a proposed LNG project 
being developed by Global Markets.  I have provided some technical support 
with respect to some onshore storage tariff issues.  

The project consists of converting an oil tanker into a floating vaporization 
facility, anchoring it off the coast of California and constructing a subsea 
pipeline to bring the gas onshore.  The facility would have a daily unloading 
rate of 500,000 mmbtu/d, taking approximately 6-7 days to fully unload a 
cargo.  Approximately 172,000 mmbtu/d would go directly to market, with the 
remainder being injected into utility storage facilities for ultimate 
withdrawal prior to arrival of a new shipment of LNG (roughly 11 days).  The 
goal is to baseload a market of 172,000 mmbtu/d.

The project would have a start-up date in early 2003.  While other proposals 
are being considered to bring LNG into California, the Enron proposal is 
unique in that it is considering onshore gas storage vs offshore LNG 
storage.  Retrofitting the oil tanker takes approximately 18 months.  
Constructing an offshore LNG storage facility would take 3 years -  providing 
Enron a competitive advantage with respect to timing.   To protect this 
competitive advantage during the development stage of the project, it has 
been requested that this particular aspect  be kept confidential.

Dear larry,

It's hard to believe that summer is almost here, but my 
calendar is already filling up with graduations, weddings, 
family gatherings and barbeques.  As a photographer, one 
of my favorite things about these happy occasions is being 
able to take great pictures and share them with friends.  
I hope you're able to do the same at your summertime events 
this year.  We've included some tips in this newsletter to 
make sure you're prepared to capture those memorable 
moments.  Have fun!  

Cheers,
  
James Joaquin 
President & CEO, Ofoto, Inc.

$10,000 Reasons to Smile Contest Winners

Ofoto members certainly gave us many reasons to smile this 
spring -- we were overwhelmed with the number of fantastic 
pictures we received for our contest. Choosing our 
favorites was tough, but we were eventually able to narrow 
them down to three winners: Grand Prize winner Doug White 
of Fishers, IN; 2nd Prize winner Michele Yurgaitis of 
Enfield, CT; and 3rd Prize winner Carolyn De Anda of 
Clovis, CA.  Congratulations and thanks to everybody who

Creative Clicks

You continue to amaze us with your ingenuity -- our 
Creative Clicks mailbox was overflowing with ideas from 
our readers!  Gardner Smith of Emeryville, CA shared with 
us how he uses Ofoto to enhance his dog walking service:

""I can't tell you how much Ofoto means to my business.  
I own The Rockridge Dog Co. here in the Bay Area and as a 
selling point I use your service.  Every dog that I take 
on as a client gets its own album, and being able to get 
up-to-date photos to people is fantastic!  It really sets 
me apart from the competition.  Keep up the great work!""

We had a very good work session with GE today to iron out the details of the 
break out contract.  We expect to have a draft on Monday, which should be

document.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

I wanted to inform you of an investment opportunity with Shawn Gross.  =20
=20
He planning on developing a 2.5-acre tract at the corner of Kirby &  Braesw=
ood.  This location as you know is close to the medical center area  and su=
rrounded quality old neighborhoods.  Two apartments in the area have  been =
very successful.  The Providence across the street is getting rental  rates=
 in the $1.22 per square foot and Kirby Place, an older apartment complex, =
 is getting $1.13 per square foot.
=20
The preliminary plan is to develop three or four story structures with a  t=
otal of approximately 110 or 150 units, respectively.  The total  project c=
ost are projected to be $8.1 million or $10.9 million.  Capital  required f=
or this development is between $1.6 million (for the three story  developme=
nt) and $2.2 million (for the four story development).  An  additional call=
 later on during development could be around $200,000 due to  increasing co=
sts (i.e, increase in lumber prices).  The property would  probably be comp=
leted 18 months out.  Projected IRRs are between 20% to 28%  depending on t=
he sale of the property.  Return on Cash Invested starts at  approximately =
11% in 2002 and increases steadily up 20% around 2006.   Assumptions are: $=
1.22 per square foot rents; revenues & expenditures rising  3.5%; vacancy l=
oss of 5%; Cap Rate of 8.5%; total project cost between $8.1  million and $=
10.9 million, depending on three or four stories.  There is an  issue with =
the property being in the 100-Year Floodplain, but he is proposing to  alle=
viate the problem by creating a water feature on the property and raise the=
  grade of builderable area above the Floodplane.
=20
I spoke to Jenard about the project before I've been able to discuss it  fu=
rther with Shawn.  I asked him about some of the assumptions, such  as the =
rental rates and cap rates which I thought where a bit aggressive.   He tol=
d me to the contrary, that Shawn's other project is pulling in  similar rat=
es, as well as other non-Shawn projects.  With regards to the  cap rate, he=
 said that he has been seeing 8%, which would call for a greater  sales pri=
ce than the assumed 8.5% (I can discuss this in further detail for  anyone =
who doesn't understand cap rates).  Jenard is investing 15% of  the capital=
 required as a limited partner (same terms as the rest of the  partners) an=
d Shawn is investing 5% (4% as a limited partner, 1% as GP).   Shawn will b=
e the developer, JMG Builders will be doing the construction, and  JMG Mana=
gers, Ltd. will be managing the property.  In otherwords, Dad will  have hi=
s construction company and management company doing the project.   Shawn wi=
ll be the developer.  While the property is under operation there  should b=
e distributions (not treated as capital returned).  At the time of  sale, m=
ortgage refinance, or other capital event, after all debts have been  repai=
d, all of the partners will get their capital contribution back.   Then, pr=
ofits are distributed.  I can go through the partnership structure  for tho=
se who are interested, which includes distributions and fees.  =20
=20
I am considering investing in 1% to 2% of the deal.  A 1% percent  investme=
nt amounts to either $16,000 or $22,000 invested, depending on the three  o=
r four story scenario, plus the possible additonal cash call of $2,000.   T=
here are several risks (i.e., softening of rental rates) which dooesn't mak=
e  the returns a guarantee.  However, I feel good about the Houston  econom=
y and absorption rates in the residental (and commercial) markets for  Hous=
ton.  Feedback from Jenard regarding his developments in  Houston and Steve=
 Keller's South Rice Apartment development have all been  extremely positiv=
e.  Shawn's personal developments include:  one in  Houston completed and d=
oing great;  the other Houston project never got  developed because someone=
 offered him so much money on the land, he and his  partners had to take it=
 (not a bad problem considering it took the risk out of  developing and ret=
urned an enormous IRR to the investors).  Although he has  not developed mu=
ch, his father is an investor and will have some  involvement.  Money inves=
ted would be tied-up for at least two years  (unless something happens like=
 his last project), but up until a sale which  could take between 2 to 5 ye=
ars (or longer) there could be distributions.   That assumes that the proje=
ct is doing well.
=20
Anyway, please let me know if any of you are interested.  The deal  is sche=
duled to fund June 10.  Like I said, I have not heard from him  on all the =
specifics.  Therefore, I don't know at this time how much is of  the deal i=
s even available.  I would be glad to discuss this in greater  detail with =
any of you that are interested.

		 Subject: Canadian Form of Physical Power Master Agreement

Please find attached for your information/review the final form of the 
Canadian Physical Power Master Agreement to be implemented and used by Enron 
Canada to trade physical power in Canada.  This form has been created using 
the EEI form of master used by Enron North America, the Canadian gas master 
and the British Energy Power Purchase Agreement.  Wherever possible and 
particularly with respect to many of the procedural provisions, such as 
billing, confirming, triggering events and the miscellaneous provisions, I 
have used the language from the current form of Canadian gas master both to 
create consistency between our Canadian gas and power businesses for our 
operations, systems and accounting groups and to hopefully make it easier for 
our commercial people to market the power paper to counterparties, as it will 
be very similar in many respects to our form of gas master with which many 
counterparties will already be familiar.

Regarding the power products tradeable under this master, further to a 
discussion Peter and I had with Jeff Hodge and Christian Yoder, the products 
described in Schedule A have been created based upon an amalgam of the EEI 
products and the WSPP schedules of products.  Given the uncertainty of how 
exactly the two Canadian markets that are set to open in 2001 will look, it 
was determined best to have a minimum of broadly defined products, which will 
be further defined over time as the markets develop, rather than trying to 
introduce a large number of complex products that may end up neither 
applicable nor appropriate and which would only serve to make negotiations of 
the form with counterpartys more difficult.

I would ask each of you to review the form and provide me with any final 
comments you may have at your earliest convenience so that Enron Canada can 
commence marketing the paper to counterparties.  In performing your review, 
please keep in mind that this master is intended to be an agreement that is 
cross-jurisdictional and, therefor, general in scope and nature and will be 
equally applicable to power trades in Alberta as in Ontario (or any other 
province over time).  Any jurisdictional specific provisions will be built 
into the confirms on a trade by trade basis.  Nevertheless, particularly for 
Rob Hemstock and Aleck Dadson, I do want to ensure that we have not included 
any provisions that may cause Enron Canada any concerns in Ontario or Alberta 
based upon our current understanding of how those two regulatory regimes will 
unfold.

Thanks for your assistance on this matter and I look forward to any comments 
you may have on the document.

Subject: LNG for Spain

Some follow up on friday's meeting:

We need to focus quickly on whether or not there is any deal to be done with 
Middle East suppliers that can contribute to Enron Europe's power project in 
Spain.

Our pending deal with Adgas to ship LNG on the Heogh Galleon could be a good 
fit however  the current volume being discussed (0.3 MMTA) is only a small 
portion of the 1.3 to 1.5 MMTA required for the project in years 03+ (minimum 
delivery would be 1.0 MMTA).  We should press ADGAS to see if they would 
commit to a higher volume.  We also need to determine what we believe is the 
most effective pricing structure for the ADGAS LNG purchase (both in terms of 
supply to our project in Spain, but also for potential diversions to Europe 
in 01/02) and for what term.  Based on our discussions on friday, it may be 
that a crude based purchase price may work the best.  We have discussed both 
Brent and NYMEX based pricing formulas with ADGAS.  Merritt, Eric, lets add 
that to the agenda for our monday morning meeting and get some price 
structuring done.

The structure of the ADGAS deal will be based on a U.S. delivery.  We will 
reserve the right to divert to any other market (except TEPCO).  We will 
likely have to share, in some way the shipping savings, if we divert to a 
non-U.S. terminal but I think we can keep any upside made on the indexed 
portion of the price for ourselves.

In addition we will be contacting OMAN LNG to determine their ability to 
provide quantities to augment the ADGAS supplies, as well as potential 
shipping options (Exmar?)  Obviously we need to consider shipping 
requirements for our Atlantic Basin projects (i.e. Elba Island) when thinking 
about shipping for Spain.  I would also like to look at how Elba could be 
used as part of a potential take or pay avoidance strategy for the Spain 
power plant.

I will try to keep everyone updated as the pieces come together.

Thanks

Richard -

I understand we'll be meeting next week.  I figured one of the first things 
you'd be asking me for is an accounting on what Enron spent on the power 
plant, so I thought I'd pre-empt you and send it in advance.

Chris,

The attached schedule details the $1.3 million of costs incurred on the NSM 
Power Plant Project.  Note that until December 1999 these costs were deferred 
costs on our balance sheet.  In December, however, we wrote these costs off.

Thanks,
Frank

Frank -

Would it be possible to get a printout of all the expenses incurred on the 
NSM Power Plant AFE?  An itemized list and total would be perfect if that is 
possible.  I need the list because ECT is being sued over their involvement 
and one allegation would be helped if we can prove that we were very 
committed to making the project work (e.g., through spending a lot of time 
and money on the power plant).

I'll need this by Tuesday afternoon if possible to give to the ECT 
attorneys.  Sending it by e-mail would be best so I can add a note and 
forward it on.

Thanks,

Chris

Subject: systems developments in london

we are working with the systems development group here in london to create 
for the global products trading group a curve spreadsheet and options
calculator (can do cracks spreads and asian options).  the aim is that we can 
have a central site that is accessible to other groups and all 
traders/marketers in this group to facilitate our ability to service customer 
business.  brian hudson is the person who developed this system for the gas 
and power groups here in europe and has been recommened to us by steven 
leppard who heads the IT research department.   Without going into the 
systems history story here I think we are inadequately prepared on this side 
and need to strengthen in this area.  We understand from Steve that in order 
for them to dedicate the resources required for what we are asking they would 
like to take on an additional person that would be partly for our and the 
coal group's acct.  Steve can keep this individual busy with other projects 
so it would not be a full time expense for Global Products.  our excel 
spreadsheets methodology is not stable enough given the increasing 
unreliability of the London servers which keep falling over and thus the 
traders without any pricing tools.  This is what brought about our 
discussions with the IT department to try and improve the present system.

Attached are the transaction documents for Project Tahiti.  Each of the 
documents is marked to show revisions against the version circulated last 
Wednesday, August 30.  As we discussed on the phone, we have incorporated the 
business agreement reached between CIBC and Enron, as follows:

The Tahiti Series Trust Agreement has been revised to require the consent of 
all certificateholders (which includes Fiji Z LLC, which can only consent 
with the consent of its Class B Member - CIBC) prior to (i) the creation of 
any series after December 31, 2000 (see definition of Series Supplement) and 
(ii) making any amendments to the purpose provision (which specifically 
limits the purposes of the Trust to holding Trust Property - defined as the 
warrants) or the definition of Series Supplement.

The Subscription Agreement has been revised to provide that CIBC's commitment 
to fund on December 31, 2000 will be terminated if the Bali Trust receives 
any funds except in connection with the issuance of debt of the Bali Trust 
(which would require the consent of CIBC as the beneficial owner) or funds 
received from CIBC.

Please be aware that because of the revisions described above, it was not 
necessary to incorporate  all of Tim Elwood's comments received September 3, 
2000.

The documents in WordPerfect format are identified as follows:

Jim,                                In 1998,  ENA removed from its balance 
sheet a loan made to The American Coal Company through a transaction with 
Society Generale.  In 1999 the deal was restructured and Soc Gen was taken 
out by Bank of America.  As part of both transactions, there was an  absolute 
put agreement to Enron in favor of Soc Gen and B of A.  B of A has indicated 
it intends to exercise the put which will have the effect of moving the loan 
back on the books of Enron.  Enron's business people don't want this to 
happen and are going to arrange to have a Whitewing entity buy out the B of A 
position.  In order to timely complete the project, outside counsel needs to 
be engaged.  John Dawson at Vinson & Elkins worked on the original 
transaction and has been contacted about this project.  Please acknowledge 
that it is acceptable to use John Dawson and the firm of Vinson & Elkins on 
this project.  The dollar amount of the transaction is approximately 
$92.0mm.  Thank you for your quick response as the business parties want to 
close the deal asap.  John West

Audrey,

Since the project is in full swing and things are moving fast, it would be good to have someone who has been involved with the project to attend and address any issues Steve's area may have.  I will ask Andy Brady, the IT project leader,  if he can recommend someone that has been working closely with the project.

Thanks, LV

For those of you who might be working on LM6000 transactions, there is a 
rough cut of a standardized Financial Model and a old Capital Cost 
Configuration Model that you can use for current/future LM6000 projects. Both 
of them are saved as read-only at o:/naes/from_ko_LM6000/control. If you do 
not have access, please compose a Security Request via Lotus Notes.

Please note that there are still work to be done on both models. If you are 
assigned with any LM6000 models, please keep me in the loop, and I can fill 
you in on the model progress and process. 

Thanks.

Peter Mims is preparing a memo to me that will confirm our findings on the IP 
issues based on the contracts we have reviewed and the meeting we had 
yesterday.  I should get a copy of it today and will circulate it once it is 
finalized.  I will also prepare a list of the contracts we have reviewed.  I 
am still collecting a few agreements (Ganady Batrak's prior service agreement 
and Bob Campbells agreement) and will also be collecting copies of our 
agreements with Enron Net Works employees for review.  

With respect to the NDA's, they have all been drafted and it is my 
understanding that they were sent to our counterparties last week.  Oracle 
has already signed an NDA and I have a copy if you would like to have it.  I 
would suggest that before we have further conversations with Oracle that we 
consider asking them to also sign a non-solicitation agreement with us.  The 
NDA with Oracle is the only NDA that does not contain a non-solicitation 
provision.  

In order to facilitate getting the rest of NDA's signed as quickly as 
possible, I would suggest that Rex ask each of his contacts for the name and 
phone number of the legal counsel reviewing the agreement and I will give 
them a call and find out if they have any issues that need to be resolved.  
Obviously the i2 contract should be our priority.

FYI- I received a call from the contact at PriceWaterhouseCoopers and we will 
send him a NDA directly.

Sounds good so far.

What I want by the end of today is a complete inventory of legal contracts 
reviewed and a final risk memo completed by Enron and outside council.  We 
need to make sure we have a complete list of agreements, that they have all 
been reviewed and that any risks found are summarized in a memo and we need 
it done today so we can make sure we can keep our i2 meeting Thursday.

I also want the technology audit summary completed today for the same reasons 
as the legal audit above.  I want clear documentation that the system is 
severable, what was audited and that we know if we are going to have any 
issues upon a due diligence.

I also want a completed update of the NDA list by this afternoon.  What stage 
we are in, if there are issues, etc.  We need the i2 NDA signed today.  We 
will cancel the meeting with them Thursday if it is not signed and in our 
hands very soon.  I would like the Oracle one done in the next few days and 
the IBM one done as soon as possible.  

Let's meet at the end of today to finalize these three issues.

I will see you at 2 PM for the demo.

Thanks.

of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet

considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an

of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing

information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

I think we are making great progress on the systems side.  I would like to 
set a deadline of November 10th to have a plan on all North American projects 
(I'm ok if fundementals groups are excluded) that is signed off on by 
commercial, Sally's world, and Beth's world.  When I say signed off I mean 
that I want signitures on a piece of paper that everyone is onside with the 
plan for each project.  If you don't agree don't sign. If certain projects 
(ie. the gas plan) are not done yet then lay out a timeframe that the plan 
will be complete.  I want much more in the way of specifics about objectives 
and timeframe.

Thanks for everyone's hard work on this.

Cindy,

At this time, Energy Operations is not prepared to sign off that SAP 
development for Energy Operations has been completed and that based on what 
was seen at user reviews all requirements have been met.  Having been in your 
position on other projects, I understand your need for this sign-off.  In an 
effort to focus both our teams on resolving and remaining outstanding issues, 
we can provide the following list of known items which remain unclear to us.

Mapping profit centers/books
Inability to unit test the power interface due to lack of profit center 
definition for power
AR reporting by product/coordinator/counterparty
Reversal of prepay accruals for Financial Settlements
Netting control point for AP
Reporting Entities (Co 842)
Report Requirements
Cash forecasting tools
Netting intercompany offsetting 3rd party (FX)
Monetizations
Controls on writeoffs
Flex file upload

Call Melissa at X35704 for detailed explanations.  I'm available as always at 
X33179.

Vince, I hope you are well.

A question if I may.

I noticed that EBS's allocation for 2001 from the corporate research group's 
budget was $1.44m. Could you please give me an 'heads-up' on what I can 
expect for the dollars - in terms of people, on-going projects, anticipated 
work-program. I'm aware that Stinson in our point person, but I've seen him 
for a long while. A breakdown/schedule would be great.

I appreciate your help.

Thanks.

Hello.  Do you think this should be included in our consulting agreement

Subject: Agreements with non-employee contractors



Michelle,

While I think that ""Enron"" discourages entering into agreements for services
directly with non-employee contractors, there are times when a business
decision is made to do so on a very limited basis.  Aside from other legal
issues, one single issue that has received a lot of attention in recent years
is the issue addressed by the Microsoft case involving the question under
what circumstances are individuals designated as independent contractors
entitled to employee benefits provided by  an employer to its employees.

While we have amended the various employee benefit plans to address this
issue, another place where it can be effectively addressed is in the contract
for services.

Recently, I was involved with a project to develop provisions to be included
in such a service agreement with non-employee contractors who will not be
entitled to employee benefits.  I thought you might have an interest in this,
so I have attached the contract provisions that were developed for this
circumstance along with an analysis.

I wonder if there are other attorneys who design and draft such agreements
who would be interested in receiving this information?

Regards,

Pat

Subject:	2002 IM Structure

Tracy, as the ETS overall planner, the Property Accounting Users Group requests that you instruct the ISC to roll over the current IM structure for 2002 for both ETS Consolidated and ETS Un-Consolidated.  This will allow for the setting up of 2002 projects (to be saved they must be attached to a 2002 Budget code)  and when the 2002 capital budget is approved, allow for the inputting of the 2002 budget.  No transfer of dollars is involved in the roll over.  This is strictly a structure roll over.   

Please email Marian Bryant with the ISC the approval for the roll over and the date you would like for this to happen.  The Users group is recommending for this to be done November 1st.   If you have specific questions or concerns, please contact Marian directly, x55944.

Apology not necessary!  However, you are very kind to consider my
perspective on the group and project.  I am certainly a bit frustrated with
how this project is turning out.  We should have ""white boarded"" our ideas
and reached consensus in the very beginning I think.  It would have saved
all of us time.  I'm counting on Mark to drive this home for us smoothly.

But, at the end of the day, I am pleased with how much I learned in Tasker's
class, which is the ultimate point anyway.

Carolyn:

I wanted to apologize for the way the group dynamic has shaped up.  It's
clear to me that you're a bit frustrated, and if I've contributed, I
apologize.

You've done the most work on this project, your contribution has been very
significant, and I personally am not satisfied about the way that the stuff
you've pulled together (and your views) have been included.  At some point,
though, it gets tough beating one's head against the wall.  Seems to me
that, in a group, everyone should have some of their views
included---that's what groups and compromises are all about.  After all,
it's school.  We've made a lot of sacrifices to do it, and the point is to
learn.

Anyway, I hope you'll still comment on the presentation, and I'm glad that
you've agreed to do part of it on Thursday.  For my part, I felt that I
pushed yesterday about as much as I'm prepared to push and at this point,
I'll put the ratios tables together, offer a few edits, buy don' t see much
use going to the mat.

Overall, I think it'll be an okay presentation, though getting there has
been, well, bumpy.

But thanks very much for all the work you did.  It was important, and the
presentation is better off for it.

Best,
Jeff

LADWP Continues to Shine Despite California's Dark Period
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Reduced electricity supplies across the state forced the California=20
Independent
System Operator (Cal-ISO) on Tuesday to declare a Stage One Power Emergency
for the second consecutive day. The Cal-ISO is calling on all California
electricity customers to increase their energy-conservation efforts, and
urging them to delay turning on holiday lights until after 8 p.m. Responsib=
le
for the reliability of California's electricity grid, the Cal-ISO declares
a Stage One emergency when the state's power reserves drop to 7 percent.
In contrast, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), the
municipal utility that primarily serves the greater Los Angeles metro area,
announced that its more than 3.7 million businesses and residences are
enjoying stable electricity prices and a plentiful supply heading into
the holiday season.

ANALYSIS: What a sweet irony this must be for David Freeman, LADWP's genera=
l
manager. Just two years ago the municipal utility=01*the largest city-owned
utility in the United States=01*was ridden with massive debts and faced an
uncertain future. Now, LADWP in many ways can be seen as the only success
story on a landscape that is marked by one IOU maelstrom after another.


Let's take a step back and assess how LADWP was able to insulate itself
from the California crisis. Back in 1997, Freeman was brought on board
at LADWP (from the Cal-ISO, no less) to essentially save what was thought
to be a sinking ship. Straddled with $7.9 billion in debt, the need to
cut about 1,500 jobs and a likelihood of increasing rates for both resident=
ial
and industrial customers, Freeman's decision to take on the role of managin=
g
LADWP seemed like many to be a herculean task. Yet Freeman arrived at LADWP
with an aggressive reorganization in mind, including the primary goal of
lowering rates and becoming debt-free by 2003.

Early on, Freeman made a critical decision=01*one that in hindsight appears
to be flawless=01*for LADWP to opt out of deregulation while the state's th=
ree
IOUs (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) continued down the treacherous path of=20
restructuring.
While the IOUs began divesting themselves of generating facilities as means
of averting market power issues (due to agreements established with the
CPUC) LADWP was a prime example of public power throughout the United State=
s
electing to keep the integrated utility model. In addition, Freeman blocked
ongoing attempts by a consortium led by Duke Energy to buy LADWP's trading
unit, and thus maintained control over the muni's generation assets.

Enter the summer of California's discontent. With demand on an unexpected
increase and supplies in questionable availability, LADWP found itself
having the upper hand. The wholesale market over the last year or so clearl=
y
has favored generators, and LADWP was one of an elite group of companies
that capitalized on the disparity between supply and demand. Critics accuse=
d
LADWP of ""profiteering,"" but Freeman contended that the utility was just
taking advantage of California's flawed market. The truth is that LADWP
was in the right place at the right time, and maximized its ability to
generate cash via power trading, which it used to drive down its debt.
A shrewd move by any estimation.

The utility ran its plants flat out for most of the hot season, illustrated
by the fact that it got fined for violating emission standards. Some report=
s
indicate that LADWP earned about $45 million just from surplus power over
the course of the summer. These profits only added to what LADWP had made
in the previous year. Fiscal year 1999 wholesale energy marketing and=20
transmission
services generated $98 million, which, along with other sources of wholesal=
e
revenue, marked a growth of 118-percent over 1998.

The problems that were so well documented last summer have not stopped
with the onset of cooler temperatures. Ongoing structural problems within
the state of California continue to result in concerns about supply and
warnings of sudden increases in prices. As noted, the state continues to
face new challenges as generation that had been expected to be online has
been forced off, including a substantial amount from plants that had expire=
d
air emissions credits. A squeeze on imports from the Pacific Northwest=01*a=
nother
carry over problem from the summer=01*also has complicated the situation in
California.

And, while the state IOUs evaluate long-terms contracts with energy provide=
rs
(based on today's high prices), LADWP is free to continue with an aggressiv=
e
generation plan. Among its objectives are to add 2,900 MW of power generati=
on
within its service territory in the Los Angeles basin. The end result of
this would be less dependence on external sources for power and instant
supply available at times of peak demand. Also high on the list of Freeman'=
s
priorities is the development of generation from renewable or alternative
energy sources. Already demonstrating a good record for green power, LADWP
wants to cut its NOx  emissions at its in-basin plants by 65 percent by
2010. Toward that end, just this week LADWP announced that it has contracte=
d
for two additional fuel cell power plants that it will install in the Los
Angeles area. The first 250 kW Direct FuelCell power plant is to be deliver=
ed
in the fourth quarter of 2001, and the second in the first quarter of 2002.
A previously ordered 250 kW fuel cell power plant, announced last year,
is to be installed at the LADWP headquarters in the second quarter of 2001.


Along with having no worries about supply, LADWP customers also can look
forward to a 5-percent rate reduction that should take effect by 2002,
followed by a 10-percent rate reduction that has been proposed for 2003.
As criticism continues to mount against California's competitive wholesale
market, it certainly appears that LADWP took a prudent route by opting
out of competition and retaining its integrated model three years ago.

Chaim,

I received a number of phone messages from you.
The project is now in the hands of John and I shall
be very happy to assist him when he is ready to move.
He is looking at the licensing agreement right now.

Till then, I have to wait for him to make  a decision.
My role in this project is one of a facilitator, technical
consultant.

John:

Thanks so much for getting back to me.  We remain keenly interested in doing
the preliminary project for you so that you can know how MarketPoint works
and how it might help you.  We are ready to go on the test process as soon
as you and your people are ready.

You heard from Dr. Chaim Braun, Altos Vice President, who called you at my
request to inquire about your demonstration project.  I will mention to
Chaim that you expressed your interest via email to me.  There is no need to
phone him back until you are ready to go.  Chaim's email address is
chaim.braun@altosmgmt.com and he can be reached at the main Altos number
650.949.3541.  My personal phone number is 650.218.3069.

I look forward to working together.

Dale

Sorry so much time has passed since we last discussed your North American
Gas Model.  I am however still interested in setting up a test process to
familiarize some of our key people with the model and the database, etc.

I am now reviewing the licensing agreement that you submitted in December
and will be back in touch soon.  I need to discuss this further with the
business segments, but I suspect that our interest will be focused more on
the Long Term gas model.

Another member of your firm had called last week, but I somehow misplaced
his name and number.  I thought that an e-mail response would suffice for
now.  My apologies.

Regards,

John Goodpasture

Subject: Gas Model


Sorry so much time has passed since we last discussed your North American
Gas Model.  I am however still interested in setting up a test process to
familiarize some of our key people with the model and the database, etc.

I am now reviewing the licensing agreement that you submitted in December
and will be back in touch soon.  I need to discuss this further with the
business segments, but I suspect that our interest will be focused more on
the Long Term gas model.

Another member of your firm had called last week, but I somehow misplaced
his name and number.  I thought that an e-mail response would suffice for
now.  My apologies.

Regards,

John Goodpasture

Team,
These are some points for discussion on the conference call next week.
In todays market, I think we all can agree that the profitability is there,
the only hurdle might be environmental or the potential for two phase flow.
If we could start with these points for discussion, and come to some
resolve on these issues, we can move to the logistics of the project.

   Results of the modeling conducted on the pipeline identifying the
   potential two phase flow. ( Ken Chow)
   Potential environmental concerns. (Emissions, Possible accumulation of
   liquid, Disposal of potential liquid).
        ( Larry Campbell )

Sense this project will be taking advantage of peaks in the market, the
most logical answer is to make this equipment portable. If we plan on long
term benefits at the California border, this could be a permit installation
with a pipeline hookup from a new rail facility in Needles. But, other
areas might be identified like inlets to power plants that justify portable
equipment with NGL supplied by truck. Supplying the butane by truck from
rail facility's like the one in Mohave, might also be a way to get the
project in Needles on-line sooner. Just some topic's for discussion.

   Natural Gas and NGL Pricing projections. ( Kevin Hyatt )
   Alternate points to inject the butane. ( Norm Spalding, Earl Chanley )
   Rail car leasing and availability. ( Randy Lagrimini, Larry Garrett )
   Rail carriers in the area, cost of transportation. ( Randy Lagrimini,
   Larry Garrett )
   Trucking companies in the area and cost of transportation. ( Randy
   Lagrimini, Larry Garrett )
   Mohave rail rack. ( Larry Garrett )
   Rail Rack construction cost. ( Randy Lagrimini, Rick Suderman )
   Pipeline construction cost from rail rack to injection point. ( Randy
   Lagrimini, Rick Suderman )
   NGL Storage cost. ( Rick Suderman )

If there is anything I have missed or need to add, let me know

Conference call number   (877) 795-3687
Code Number         625465
The call is set for 10:00 am Central Time Tuesday 1-30 but if it does not
affect anyone's schedule, I would like to change it to Wednesday 1-31.  Let
me know if this works

See you then
Rick

Subject: Update - Proposed Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Rick,

You will recall Steve Kean participated in a conference call on Nov 14 with 
John Lavorato et al to discuss emergency Pool Rule changes that the Power 
Pool intended to implement in two days.  We developed a 5 point action plan 
to deal with the proposed Power Pool rule changes that would have a 
significant impact on the value of Enron's PPA investment in Alberta.    
By way of update to Steve, you may wish to brief him that: 1) It appears the 
Power Pool will not proceed with the rule change designed to exclude 
importers from setting pool price.  They will proceed with dispatch risk rule 
changes but we have given input on those too and I am optimistic that Enron 
will be able to live with these rule changes, the final wording of which we 
should see on Monday, 2) We  have set up a meeting with the Minister of 
Resource Development (you, Rob Milnthorp and I will attend) on December 11 to 
encourage the Alberta Government to stay the course, and 3) This week we will 
finalize our ""Lessons from other Jurisdictions"" document (that Steve sent me 
materials to include in) and will provide it to the Alberta Government and 
Power Pool and then follow up with them.

Subject: Update - Proposed Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

The attached memo provides an update on the status of the Power Pool's 
further consideration of the proposed rule changes.  In summary, it appears 
the Pool will not proceed with the proposal to exclude import offers from 
setting pool price but will recommend a rule that reduces ability of 
suppliers to become price takers on volumes that were originally priced too 
high to clear the merit order.  I will receive more specifics on the dispatch 
risk rule change on Monday.

Regards,

Rob

Subject: Clearing User Meetings

I have attached the e-mail that Ron Nolte sent to the Deal Clearing user 
community regarding the meeting
that is scheduled for November 16-17.   Please note that this is a meeting 
organized by the IT community, not
the user community.

As you may remember, Stephen Schwarz organized a similar meeting last fall in 
order to provide the IT group
with an agenda of what projects the user community considered to be priority 
projects.  However, the arrival of
EOL greatly altered the IT resources available to concentrate on those 
priority projects.  Today, the deal 
clearing community is struggling to get IT resources due to new systems such 
as ClickPaper.com, Commodity
Logic, project Thunderball  and a new weather capture and confirmation 
system.  This has created some internal 
conflict since each user group supported by the IT deal clearing applications 
group is requesting that their projects 
be set as the top priority project.  

This is a quick outline of the challenges facing both the deal clearing user 
community and the IT group supporting
this group.  I would be happy to discuss any questions you have about either 
the meeting or these challenges.

congratulations!

One thing to add to the arguments:  we have to make the adverse effect on 
consumers the centerpiece of our arguments.  We need the legal arguments too, 
but this is fundamentally a political and consumer protection driven 
discussion.  We have to be prepared to demonstrate that the key to Alberta 
reducing prices is allowing new generation to enter and to do that you have 
to allow a true market price to be posted.  California has seen the 
cancellation of numerous projects while they remain desparate for new supply 
because they have tried to artificially constrain prices.  That's not good 
for consumers.  If they need a lower cost solution for consumers (or 
protection from price volatility in the meantime) they need to ""outsource"" 
the residential supply business in blocks for fixed price bids.

Regardless of how we frame the arguments, or the solutions, however, we have 
to make the public policy/ consumer protection arguments the center of our 
written and oral presentations.

Do you agree?

		 Subject: Update - Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Dale McMaster called this afternoon to advise that the Power Pool Council 
agreed to delay any decision on the recently proposed rule changes (importers 
excluded from setting pool price and dispatch risk) for a period of two 
weeks.  During this two week period Dale has been asked to obtain stakeholder 
input into ways to address concerns about whether the spot price in the 
Alberta Power Pool is a product of interaction among competitiors in a 
efficient market.   

In our discussions with the Power Pool and ADRD today and yesterday Enron 
expressed its willingness to work with the Power Pool to provide feedback on 
suggested rule changes but has also made it clear that we do not agree with 
the premise that there is a ""problem"" that requires ""emergency"" amendments to 
the Pool rules.  Our position has been that Alberta is short supply, and 
significant changes to the rules and/or market design will only discourage 
new generation development. 

Dale McMaster had just left the Power Pool Council meeting when he called and 
had not yet put much thought into how to define the issue he has to address 
and what the process will be.   We discussed the process and it appears he 
will likely receive comments from stakeholders at large and also assemble a 
small committee of 4-5 stakeholders (which would include Enron) to work with 
the Power Pool to consider possible changes to the Pool rules.  Dale said he 
would try to pull together a ""terms of reference"" document that would define 
the mandate of the small committee by tomorrow.

After my call with Dale McMaster, Peter Keohane and I spoke to Aleck Trawick 
and we have asked Blakes to assist us in three areas:

1) Once the terms of reference of this small committee are released (and 
assuming Enron is asked to participate on the committee) Blakes will assist 
us with preparing a letter that states that Enron's participation does not 
represent acknowledgement or agreement that the Power Pool Rules must be 
amended to address the concerns of some stakeholders about real time pricing 
in Alberta and that Enron's participation on the committee is on a without 
prejudice basis;

2) Enron needs to obtain the final memo from Frontier Economics in which 
Frontier provides its opinion on how the proposed rule changes: i) would 
introduce price discrimination into the Alberta electricity market, ii) would 
be contrary to the development of an efficient, fair and openly competitive 
market for electricity, iii) would compromise the independence of the Power 
Pool, and iv) would have the expected effect of artificially depressing the 
real time price of electricity in Alberta.  Once Blakes receives a copy of 
the Frontier Economics memo, they will prepare a memo for Enron advising: i) 
whether the two week process of consultation by the Power Pool is in 
accordance with the standards required of the PPC as an administrative 
tribunal operating in Alberta; and ii) whether such rule changes offend the 
provisions of the EUA;

3) Blakes will advise Enron of the possible avenues of recourse (i.e. appeal 
to the AEUB, and/or legal action in the Court of Queen's Bench) in the event 
the proposed rule changes (or similar changes) are approved by the PPC at the 
end of this two week period.   GPC and Eric Thode will also be consulted on 
this issue and obviously input from all those within Enron working on this 
project will be sought prior to any decision being made to pursue any 
possible legal remedies.  

Please advise if you have any comments.

Regards,

Rob

		 Subject: Update - Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Dale McMaster called this afternoon to advise that the Power Pool Council 
agreed to delay any decision on the recently proposed rule changes (importers 
excluded from setting pool price and dispatch risk) for a period of two 
weeks.  During this two week period Dale has been asked to obtain stakeholder 
input into ways to address concerns about whether the spot price in the 
Alberta Power Pool is a product of interaction among competitiors in a 
efficient market.   

In our discussions with the Power Pool and ADRD today and yesterday Enron 
expressed its willingness to work with the Power Pool to provide feedback on 
suggested rule changes but has also made it clear that we do not agree with 
the premise that there is a ""problem"" that requires ""emergency"" amendments to 
the Pool rules.  Our position has been that Alberta is short supply, and 
significant changes to the rules and/or market design will only discourage 
new generation development. 

Dale McMaster had just left the Power Pool Council meeting when he called and 
had not yet put much thought into how to define the issue he has to address 
and what the process will be.   We discussed the process and it appears he 
will likely receive comments from stakeholders at large and also assemble a 
small committee of 4-5 stakeholders (which would include Enron) to work with 
the Power Pool to consider possible changes to the Pool rules.  Dale said he 
would try to pull together a ""terms of reference"" document that would define 
the mandate of the small committee by tomorrow.

After my call with Dale McMaster, Peter Keohane and I spoke to Aleck Trawick 
and we have asked Blakes to assist us in three areas:

1) Once the terms of reference of this small committee are released (and 
assuming Enron is asked to participate on the committee) Blakes will assist 
us with preparing a letter that states that Enron's participation does not 
represent acknowledgement or agreement that the Power Pool Rules must be 
amended to address the concerns of some stakeholders about real time pricing 
in Alberta and that Enron's participation on the committee is on a without 
prejudice basis;

2) Enron needs to obtain the final memo from Frontier Economics in which 
Frontier provides its opinion on how the proposed rule changes: i) would 
introduce price discrimination into the Alberta electricity market, ii) would 
be contrary to the development of an efficient, fair and openly competitive 
market for electricity, iii) would compromise the independence of the Power 
Pool, and iv) would have the expected effect of artificially depressing the 
real time price of electricity in Alberta.  Once Blakes receives a copy of 
the Frontier Economics memo, they will prepare a memo for Enron advising: i) 
whether the two week process of consultation by the Power Pool is in 
accordance with the standards required of the PPC as an administrative 
tribunal operating in Alberta; and ii) whether such rule changes offend the 
provisions of the EUA;

3) Blakes will advise Enron of the possible avenues of recourse (i.e. appeal 
to the AEUB, and/or legal action in the Court of Queen's Bench) in the event 
the proposed rule changes (or similar changes) are approved by the PPC at the 
end of this two week period.   GPC and Eric Thode will also be consulted on 
this issue and obviously input from all those within Enron working on this 
project will be sought prior to any decision being made to pursue any 
possible legal remedies.  

Please advise if you have any comments.

Guys, I will forward the info as it becomes available.  There appears to be 
one project in Texas and one in California which are well down the 
development road.  If interested in these projects, which have to meet a 
December 2001 COD in order to get the tax credit, I would suggest that we 
purchase the development sites and turbines from Enron Wind and keep the 
asset, commodity position, tax credit and possible green credits in ENA.  
They are Ok with that strategy.  This is an opportuntity that needs to 
fleshed out fairly quickly - Ben and Dave can you lead this analysis with 
close contact with Doug and Tim on the desk.  We can get together to discuss 
if you like.

FYI--unless I'm mistaken, the assignment that Steve gave Mike was a very 
quick and dirty analysis as I recall, i.e., should by no means be the tail 
that wags the dog.

P.S.  I eye-balled Mike's numbers, below.  Looks like about $75K for three 
months.

Best,
Jeff

Recall that we terminated all retainers with Mike at the end of April and 
have no RCR approval for Mike for work in May.  

I called Mike and yelled at him for assuming he can work on issues with 
Sandy's approval but without RCR approval.  I called Sandi and she will 
present a number of RCRs--see below.  

I don't think we need Mike's help on windfalls profits--our position is clear 
and the research is done.  
Today and tomorrow, he's participating in two meetings with the Direct Access 
Coalition at my request to support the language we (read ""he"") drafted.   We 
should get Leslie more integrated on this effort--but will not be able to 
completely reduce Mike's work.

I'm really not sure what to do on power plant siting.  

Also, I'm not sure what we should do about the Global Settlement stuff.  
Apparently, Steve has already requested that Mike do some work on an issue 
(how to insert a poison pill--if the Global Settlement is upset by litigation 
or an AG indictment??).  I am very concerned that we may lose control over 
the issues or the forum unless we centralize the assignments in Jeff or 
Steve.

Subject: Proposal for Legal Services RCR

Here are my proposals for RCRs related to legal services in support of Enron
legislative activities for May 2001 and the remainder of the session.  These
estimates are for Enron budgetary purposes only, and do not represent a
commitment or a ""not to exceed"" figure for Goodin, MacBride.  The actual
fees incurred may exceed these estimates, and GMSRD will bill Enron on a
hourly fee basis, as opposed to the retainer mechanism used in the first
part of this year.

1.  Direct access legislation:   This involves working on a continuing
series of bills related to direct access.  I cannot estimate a specific
amount for the entire legislative project, it depends on how long it takes
for the legislature to enact significant direct access legislation.   My
best estimate is $8,000 per month, or $24,000 over three months.  The
estimate would increase if direct access is still at issue in the session's
last month--August.  As of May 11, 2001, we have recorded approximately
$3000 in billings related to direct access in this month.

2. Improved powerplant siting and increased emission offset
legislation:   $15,000 over three months, more if the final legislative
solution is delayed until August.  We have recorded approximately $1,000 in
billings related to this area this month (through May 11, 2001).

3. Windfall profits tax bill:  This project required additional upfront
legal research regarding the constitutionality of the proposed tax.  We have
billed legal fees for approximately $4000 in May, 2001, up through May 11.
My best estimate is $18,000 over three months of session, more if the bill
is still alive in August.

4. Global settlement/Edison MOU/Plan B legislation:   This project
covers the gamut of comprehensive legislative proposals to address the
energy crisis, including a proposal by the Governor, legislation to approve
the Edison MOU or an alternative plan which does not involve purchase of the
Edison transmission system, commonly referred to as ""Plan B"".  As explained
by Paul Kaufman, this work is expected to involve less work in the near
term, and more as the legislation actually moved forward in the future.
Trying to average this increasing level of work over time is difficult, but
I am estimating $15,000 over the next three months, more if the package is
still being enacted in August.  We have recorded approximately $2000 in
billings on this issue through May 11, 2001 this month.

Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.  We
are pleased to have the opportunity to be of service to Enron, and look
forward to continuing this relationship.

energy crisis, including a proposal by the Governor, legislation to approve
the Edison MOU or an alternative plan which does not involve purchase of the
Edison transmission system, commonly referred to as ""Plan B"".  As explained
by Paul Kaufman, this work is expected to involve less work in the near
term, and more as the legislation actually moved forward in the future.
Trying to average this increasing level of work over time is difficult, but
I am estimating $15,000 over the next three months, more if the package is
still being enacted in August.  We have recorded approximately $2000 in
billings on this issue through May 11, 2001 this month.

Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.  We
are pleased to have the opportunity to be of service to Enron, and look
forward to continuing this relationship.

Within the next few months we will be transitioning from our Lotus Notes 
email system to Microsoft Outlook and also upgrading to Windows 2000.  Our 
local IT department and our developmental IT department managers are involved 
in this project and will be coordinating efforts with the software Houston 
transition team to ensure the process goes well in Portland.

Over the course of the next few days, you will be receiving an e-mail from 
Project GEM.  The purpose of this e-mail is to inventory your PC to check for 
hardware and software requirements.  Please open this e-mail only from the PC 
that is your primary one.  This procedure takes under two minutes and will 
assist us in verifying your hardware and software requirements to make your

Hi Herman,

Here's the agreement I referenced in my voice mail.  We will change it so 
that they can't buy any equipment without further written authorization from 
Enron.  Anything else?

Thanks,

Ben:

Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Plano TSS.  In 
addition, ComEd has included a cover letter which indicates a significant 
level of uncertainty regarding a '01 interconnect at Plano.  Under the 
guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission Tarriff, we are 
required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of receipt (7/7/00) 
in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the ComEd queue.  If 
we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the ComEd queue becomes 
the date of execution of the LOI.

Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron 
with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days 
(ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD 
will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an 
estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and 
PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie 
ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study 
currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the 
next 2-3 weeks).  

ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current 
interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a 
proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed 
projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all 
interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain 
current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project 
with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the 
necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line 
prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that 
this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This 
interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site 
relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).

I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe 
that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the 
interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment 
responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed 
interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this 
week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior 
to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have 
recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am 
simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in 
a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.  
From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we 
executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines 
Green Land Development, L.L.C. 

Call me if you wish to discuss.

Monday night and Tuesday?  Craig got a special deal to play golf for half price at a nice course in San Antonio.  I told him yes but I needed to check with you.  I moved our Hoffman meeting back to 5:00 on Tuesday.   I still am committed to play golf on Wednesday as well.  Let me know if this interferes with any plans or if you don't think you'll be seeing enough of me.

On Friday, May 18th, 2001 Mr. Johnny Fern?ndez, Esq. Executive Director of Codezol (Foreign Trade Zone #163 at Ponce) invited us to a meeting.  Also present was Mr. Edmundo Rodr?guez, President and CEO of Nestor Reyes, Inc. which is the biggest customs broker in Puerto Rico and are also very much involved in developing sub zones for the foreign trade zones.  Mr. Fern?ndez highly recommends the use of the office of Nestor Reyes, Inc. because of their experience in these matters.  

The following law offices have contacted us:
	* Miller & Company P.C. 
	Attorneys at Law
	Marshall V. Miller
	1825 1 Street N.W, Suite 400
	Washington, DC  20006
	Phone (202) 429-2017 Fax (202) 659-6848
	e-mail: mmiller@millerco.com

According to Mr. Fern?ndez and Mr. Rodr?guez, Mr. Miller is the most experience lawyer in the field of foreign trade zones with 31 years of experience.  He has many customers in Puerto Rico,  knows Puerto Rico, and is a frequent traveller to the Island.  He will send a brochure about his company.

	* Phelan & Mitri
	I Atlantic Street
	Standford, CT  06901
	Phone (203) 967-4140 Fax (203) 325-3056
	Mike Mitri, Esq.
	Bill Phelan, Esq.

These were the lawyers that helped Peerless get their sub zone.   According to Mr. Mitri they will charge ProCaribe between $60,000 to $65,000 for their services.  They will send us information regarding their office.

Mr. Fern?ndez and Mr. Rodr?guez recommends two sub zones one for ProCaribe and another for EcoEl?ctrica instead of one mainly because the different type of businesses.  We need a ""story"" that should be strong enough to convince the U.S. Customs in approving the sub zones.  When I mention ProCaribe's re-export capabilities, they both understand that we have a good ""story"".  They recommend Marshall Miller, Esq. to help us with our ""story"".  EcoEl?ctrica needs to put together a ""story"", and someone from their group should start to get involve in the fact finding like I am doing for ProCaribe.

The following is Nestor Reyes, Inc. address:

Lee,
 Please review the attached GTC confirm to see if this is what you want.  I 
talked to Darren Vanek about this last evening and he had no problem in 
structuring the transaction in this manner.

I am working with Roche Vitamins, who are trying to trigger a fixed price for 
the remaining term of their HPL contract, from June01 to Feb02.  They want to 
trigger a fixed price for about 400 MMBtu/d.

Rudwell - we discussed a collateral threshold of $100,000 with this entity, 
based on the limited information that we have received from this privately 
held company.  I assume this is still correct?

Dan - could you send me some draft language that we would insert into the HPL 
contract for the collateral threshold matter???  It is a typical HPL physical 
contract (HPL already has the right to request payment securities for good 
cause) - if you don't already have a copy of the contract, let me know and 
I'll fax it to you.

Roche want to review the language and get it approved internally before doing 
anything.

Thanks

Lee

Tana,

As I know that you are a lady with a great passion for, and knowledge of, 
English history, I thought that I would share with you the attached e-mail 
which was obviously written by an Englishman of the old school.  Please 
recite it to yourself using your best BBC English accent. 

Enjoy!!

Yours ever so

Mark

My efforts to install the precompiled version of Freeciv on sunone are stalled, but the Windows-only version seems to work well too. The Sun probably is more capable of standalone, unattended operation, but I don't want to build the whole package from source. Yet.

All versions of network Civilization are at www.freeciv.org. Download the precompiled binaries, unpack to the directory of your choice, and launch the executables. If you want to play by yourself, you have to launch the server and then the client. To play with others, you can run the server on any machine, with all others requiring only the client. There are also the metaservers, although server loads vary widely by time of day and week.

I've been running the server on my notebook at 172.17.172.131, but I'm not sure how to set the server to automatically admit new players while a game's in progress. I know that it can be done, because the metaservers are usually configured that way.

On Friday, May 18th, 2001 Mr. Johnny Fern?ndez, Esq. Executive Director of Codezol (Foreign Trade Zone #163 at Ponce) invited us to a meeting.  Also present was Mr. Edmundo Rodr?guez, President and CEO of Nestor Reyes, Inc. which is the biggest customs broker in Puerto Rico and are also very much involved in developing sub zones for the foreign trade zones.  Mr. Fern?ndez highly recommends the use of the office of Nestor Reyes, Inc. because of their experience in these matters.  

The following law offices have contacted us:
	* Miller & Company P.C. 
	Attorneys at Law
	Marshall V. Miller
	1825 1 Street N.W, Suite 400
	Washington, DC  20006
	Phone (202) 429-2017 Fax (202) 659-6848
	e-mail: mmiller@millerco.com

According to Mr. Fern?ndez and Mr. Rodr?guez, Mr. Miller is the most experience lawyer in the field of foreign trade zones with 31 years of experience.  He has many customers in Puerto Rico,  knows Puerto Rico, and is a frequent traveller to the Island.  He will send a brochure about his company.

	* Phelan & Mitri
	I Atlantic Street
	Standford, CT  06901
	Phone (203) 967-4140 Fax (203) 325-3056
	Mike Mitri, Esq.
	Bill Phelan, Esq.

These were the lawyers that helped Peerless get their sub zone.   According to Mr. Mitri they will charge ProCaribe between $60,000 to $65,000 for their services.  They will send us information regarding their office.

Mr. Fern?ndez and Mr. Rodr?guez recommends two sub zones one for ProCaribe and another for EcoEl?ctrica instead of one mainly because the different type of businesses.  We need a ""story"" that should be strong enough to convince the U.S. Customs in approving the sub zones.  When I mention ProCaribe's re-export capabilities, they both understand that we have a good ""story"".  They recommend Marshall Miller, Esq. to help us with our ""story"".  EcoEl?ctrica needs to put together a ""story"", and someone from their group should start to get involve in the fact finding like I am doing for ProCaribe.

The following is Nestor Reyes, Inc. address:

Monday night and Tuesday?  Craig got a special deal to play golf for half price at a nice course in San Antonio.  I told him yes but I needed to check with you.  I moved our Hoffman meeting back to 5:00 on Tuesday.   I still am committed to play golf on Wednesday as well.  Let me know if this interferes with any plans or if you don't think you'll be seeing enough of me.

Tom,

As I stated earlier, we have not given much thought to an LNG terminal in the Freeport area as we anticipated that the basis market would be in the minus $.20 range.  If you add the $.05 to $.10 to build a pipeline from the terminal to an interconnect, such a project has trouble competing with others on the table.   After talking with Daren and yourself, it may well be worth doing some more research to get better projections of what those numbers might be.  I would like to take this further and stack such a project up to others we are evaluating.  As you stated,  we need to do a better analysis of the pipeline situation in the Freeport area to evaluate the economics of the project.  Please inform me as to if and how we should proceed with this matter.

Thank You,

2001 seeking the certain appendices that the CAISO filed with FERC on a 
confidential basis on March 1, 2001.  Those filings contain aggregate bidd

Last Friday, I filed the attached letter with FERC indicating that we would

contained in the ISO appendices.  (I have attached a copy of our letter for

SoCal Edison has formally requested FERC to provide it with copies of all

I am working with Roche Vitamins, who are trying to trigger a fixed price for 
the remaining term of their HPL contract, from June01 to Feb02.  They want to 
trigger a fixed price for about 400 MMBtu/d.

Rudwell - we discussed a collateral threshold of $100,000 with this entity, 
based on the limited information that we have received from this privately 
held company.  I assume this is still correct?

Dan - could you send me some draft language that we would insert into the HPL 
contract for the collateral threshold matter???  It is a typical HPL physical 
contract (HPL already has the right to request payment securities for good 
cause) - if you don't already have a copy of the contract, let me know and 
I'll fax it to you.

Roche want to review the language and get it approved internally before doing 
anything.

Thanks

Lee

Dear all,

I completeley agree with Ben that Treasuries are the most liquid and reliable 
benchmarks. I also think that FMAs have their own advantages and 
disadvantages.

However, it looks like it would be very difficult for us to avoid using LIBOR 
as benchmark - at least to price anything related to Capital Markets (for 
example, credit default swaps) . Our prices will always be different from 
that on Capital Markets if we use benchmarks different from the Market.

As a half-way solution we can have different benchmarks - for example, use 
anything, that we decide is closest to risk-free, to value products 
significantly different from that priced on Capital markets,and LIBOR for 
everything priced on Capital Markets .

 We can adjust by manipulating other coefficients (event, liquidity, 
recovery) for our purposes, but it looks like benchmark should be LIBOR.

To avoid negative default probabilites (for highly rated reference entities) 
we can add cost fo repo and haircuts (as all bankers do).

Let us continue our discussion on this.

Slava

Subject: Choosing the Riskfree Rate

Dear all,

Following on from the discussions had with Vince et al a few weeks ago, 
regarding the problems inherent in using Treasuries as our benchmark riskfree 
curve, I've written the attached short document. My preliminary conclusions 
are as follows:

Recent turmoil in the Treasury market mostly hit 10 and 30-year bonds.
Treasuries are still the most liquid curve, and that used by banks for 
benchmarking risky debt.
There is a considerable a liquidity/scarcity premium inherent within the 
corporate-Treasury spread, which we are not taking into account. More 
accurate measurement of this premium should allow us to calculate bankruptcy 
prices based on Treasuries, which are consistent with the market.

All further comments are welcome of course.

Regards

Ben

complete the survey in one sitting. If this is not possible, you can leave
the survey site and return at a more convenient time.

As a token of our appreciation, we will send you an E*TRADE
T-shirt upon completion of the survey. The survey site will close on
Tuesday, January 23rd, at  midnight EST. If you would like to participate
in the survey and receive a t-shirt, please be sure to complete your survey
by this time.

Below is a hyperlink to the website where you will find the
survey. Again, we would encourage you to complete the survey at a convenient
time and in one sitting.

In advance, thank you very much for your time and we greatly
appreciate your willingness to participate!

(Note: The web survey will run more efficiently when you do
not have other applications open during the time you are completing it.)

Mark, I heard earlier today that the resolution of this matter has been to 
move confirmation/documentation to Calgary, but leave contract preparation 
and negotiation in Houston.  

I must admit disappoint with this bifurcated result, including for the 
following reasons:

1.  It has left, rightly or (I trust) wrongly, the impression that there is 
concern as to the ability of the Canadian lawyers to documment and negotiate

the Canadian traders and originators, and their advice is sought and followed

notably, all structured trades and trades with a term of greater than one

Chris,

The System Test environment has not been available this morning for a couple
of reasons.  During the code migration code last evening which resolved the
problem of Power Prices not displaying correctly, an unrelated problem arose
with one of the application controls that handles some of the grid display
features.  During one of the comipiles the .dll was corrupted.  This has
required us to rebuild the control and update the entire application to
reference the newly rebuilt contol's class id.  Although the Power products
have been active since last night, we have been unable to bring the system
test environment on-line for testing because of the corrupted application
control.  We anticipate that the system will be back up within the next
hour, by 2pm (barring any other unforeseen problems).  We apologize for any
inconvenience that we've caused for the Enron testing effort this morning.

To address Enron's concerns expressed to you during this morning's
conference call, here is what we are currently doing in each of these areas:

Performance of the system - We believe we know exactly what is causing the
performance problem.  However, the person that is best qualified to resolve
that problem has been extremely busy addressing other issues, such as
verifying that the integrity of the data and messages that are sent back and
forth are accurate.  This person will spend the majority of today and
tomorrow fine-tuning performance.  We have a very high degree of confidence
that we can improve performance in short order to the level that is
acceptable to Enron.

Power Prices - We observed some problems with the Power filters and took
these products offline yesterday so that we could work on the problem.  We
believe the problem has been resolved and have migrated the code to System
Test.  Although Power Prices are available right now, the System Test
environment is offline right now due to code migrations unrelated to the
power issue.

Notification of Failed Transactions - The concern is that when a user's
order results in an attempted transaction against EOL and a Failure message
is received from Enron, the True Quote system does not display a message to
the user explaining that Counterparty was not available to fill the order.
We have analysts working on the notification messages right now.  If a
user's order is submitted with a duration of 'Fill or Kill' and the order is
not filled at least partially, we plan to push a message notification to the
user stating the following:  ""Your order was received by the system;
however, no counterparties were available to fill your request"".  We may
also display a 'small print' disclaimer at the bottom of the message that
says:  *Orders may not be filled due to unavailable volume, credit
limitations, or another platform particpant acquiring the volume slightly
ahead of your order request.""  The wording of this message is pending
approval by True Quote executive management.    These changes will be
migrated to System Test this weekend.

Stress Testing - We are also concerned with the lack of stress testing that
we have been able to perform and have been concerned with amount of
realistic functionality testing that can be accomplished given the
compressed testing timeframe.  True Quote is dedicated to completing as much
functional testing and performance tuning as possible and will have our
entire team here all weekend to press forward with these efforts.  It was
our understanding that Enron and True Quote management had decided to forego
stress testing in order to take this system into production by March 12.  We
have assumed and planned for more rigorous stress testing using the System
Test environment AFTER March 12 to improve performance over the coming
weeks.  If management has now decided that a thorough and complete system
wide stress test is a pre-production requirement, then we agree that March
12 is not a realistic Go-Live date.

Yesterday, we received several errors from EOL when we attempted to login
and when we attempted to execute transactions.  The following is a list of
errors that we received throughout the day:

9:07 a.m. to 9:10 a.m.	Received three ""Internal Server Error - Unable to
process request"" messages
12:10 a.m.		Received three ""Internal Server Error - Unable to process
request"" messages
12:13 a.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with ""Failure: Broker user's session
invalid"" message
12:14 a.m.		Receved ""A connection with the server could not be established""
message
12:15 a.m.		Received ""Failure msg = User not found in session"" Code = ""Bus""
message
12:25 a.m. 		Received ""Internal Server Error - Unable to process request""
message
2:43 p.m.		Received two Attempt Transactions failed with ""Failure: Broker
user's session invalid"" messages
2:51 p.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with ""Failure: Broker user's session
invalid"" message
3:06 p.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with ""Failure: Broker user's session
invalid"" message
4:47 p.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with ""Counterparty has no offer access
to product"" message

We are concerned about the stability of the Enron servers.  Could you please
ask Bob in investigate why we are getting these types of errors throughout
the day?  We are also concerned that the process for verifying the status of
a transaction that has not completed in a reasonable amount of time is not
yet in place at Enron.  We see this as a critical process that must be in
place and working before we go live.  In addition, we have experienced
things like receiving messages that we had not anticipated, receiving random
credit updates that we thought we had agree that we would not receive, and
changes in XML attributes and content that we had not seen in previous
testing.

We are working very hard to address issues as quickly as we can and
appreciate very much having Matt Mottsinger addressing issues on Enron's
side as quickly as possible.  We will take their offer on using Matt to a
higher degree.  If it makes sense for him to be here at our site this
weekend, than we are happy to find him place to work in our environment, but
if it makes more sense to have him available from Enron's location, we can
stay in contact with him via telephone.

 NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : November 30, 2000

EIA Rolls Out Long List of New Gas-Fired Power 
Between 2000 and 2004, a total of 145,417 MW of nonutility generation is 
expected to be added to the U.S. power grid and 83% of that total will be 
gas-fired power generation, according to a new survey by the Energy 
Information Administration. 

The EIA's Inventory of Nonutility Electric Power Plants in the United States 
find that a total of 799 new gas-fired units, totaling 120,645 MW in 
nameplate capacity, are scheduled to be added by the end of 2004.  The 
Southeastern Electric Reliability Council is expected to receive the largest 
portion of new nonutility generation with an additional 252 units totaling 
36,636 MW.  SERC is followed by ERCOT with 109 new units totaling 21,775 MW, 
ECAR with an expected 181 additional units totaling 17,733 MW and MAIN with 
140 new units totaling 17,139 MW. 

The largest amount of new nonutility capacity, or about 61,823 MW, is 
expected to be added in 2002.  About 46,551 MW of new capacity is scheduled 
to be in service next year. 

Electric restructuring has led to a boom in nonutility power generation.  The 
EIA report found that total nonutility generation in 1999 reached 167,357 MW, 
which was a 71% increase from the previous year.  However, only 21% of the 
total represented new plants.  In 1999, about 50,000 MW of electric utility 
generation assets were purchased by nonutility generation companies.  At the 
end of 1999, nonutility generation accounted for 19.8% of total electric 
generation in the country.  The totals reported by EIA include all operable 
units, even those that did not run at all in 1999 but are expected to return 
to service. 

Gas-fired power accounted for the largest share of nonutility generation last 
year, and the Pacific Census Division accounted for 31.4% of that gas-fired 
capacity. The Pacific Census Division also accounted for the greatest number 
(1,167) of total nonutility generation and the most nonutility capacity 
(33,254 MW). California was the dominant state in the division with 30,189 
MW. 

Gas-fired (only) generation represented 29.4% (49,353 MW) of total nonutility 
capacity in 1999, and petroleum/natural gas (fuel switchable/combined) 
generation accounted for 24.2% (40,508 MW) of the total. Coal represented 
28.9% (48,501 MW).  Hydroelectric power accounted for 3.6%. Petroleum (only) 
totaled 2.2% and all other sources amounted to 11.5% of total nonutility 
generation. 

The top five states based on existing nameplate capacity are California 
(30,189 MW), Illinois (24,013 MW), New York (17,256 MW), Pennsylvania (12,483

 NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : November 30, 2000

EIA Rolls Out Long List of New Gas-Fired Power 
Between 2000 and 2004, a total of 145,417 MW of nonutility generation is 
expected to be added to the U.S. power grid and 83% of that total will be 
gas-fired power generation, according to a new survey by the Energy 
Information Administration. 

The EIA's Inventory of Nonutility Electric Power Plants in the United States 
find that a total of 799 new gas-fired units, totaling 120,645 MW in 
nameplate capacity, are scheduled to be added by the end of 2004.  The 
Southeastern Electric Reliability Council is expected to receive the largest 
portion of new nonutility generation with an additional 252 units totaling 
36,636 MW.  SERC is followed by ERCOT with 109 new units totaling 21,775 MW, 
ECAR with an expected 181 additional units totaling 17,733 MW and MAIN with 
140 new units totaling 17,139 MW. 

The largest amount of new nonutility capacity, or about 61,823 MW, is 
expected to be added in 2002.  About 46,551 MW of new capacity is scheduled 
to be in service next year. 

Electric restructuring has led to a boom in nonutility power generation.  The 
EIA report found that total nonutility generation in 1999 reached 167,357 MW, 
which was a 71% increase from the previous year.  However, only 21% of the 
total represented new plants.  In 1999, about 50,000 MW of electric utility 
generation assets were purchased by nonutility generation companies.  At the 
end of 1999, nonutility generation accounted for 19.8% of total electric 
generation in the country.  The totals reported by EIA include all operable 
units, even those that did not run at all in 1999 but are expected to return 
to service. 

Gas-fired power accounted for the largest share of nonutility generation last 
year, and the Pacific Census Division accounted for 31.4% of that gas-fired 
capacity. The Pacific Census Division also accounted for the greatest number 
(1,167) of total nonutility generation and the most nonutility capacity 
(33,254 MW). California was the dominant state in the division with 30,189 
MW. 

Gas-fired (only) generation represented 29.4% (49,353 MW) of total nonutility 
capacity in 1999, and petroleum/natural gas (fuel switchable/combined) 
generation accounted for 24.2% (40,508 MW) of the total. Coal represented 
28.9% (48,501 MW).  Hydroelectric power accounted for 3.6%. Petroleum (only) 
totaled 2.2% and all other sources amounted to 11.5% of total nonutility 
generation. 

The top five states based on existing nameplate capacity are California 
(30,189 MW), Illinois (24,013 MW), New York (17,256 MW), Pennsylvania (12,483 
MW) and Texas (12,376 MW).

Per our conversation, I understand that the Canadian company has a number of 
outstanding OTC FX transactions with one or more counterparties.  Each of 
those transactions should be documented by a confirmation which confirms the 
economic terms of each deal.  Each confirmation must be subject to (1) an 
existing type of master agreement (such as the ISDA, IFEMA, FEOMA), (2) a 
""deemed"" version of such an agreement or (3) ""terms and conditions"" appearing 
in the confirmation itself.  It is quite likely that in any of these three 
types of confirmations, there are provisions for assignment of trades, credit 
event upon merger, material adverse change, additonal events of default or 
termination, etc.  which may be triggered by the pending acquisiton of the 
Canadian company.  Further, there may be credit issues associated with the 
transactions and/or master agreements (in the form of specific credit 
provisions in a confirmation or a credit annex to the master agreement).  As 
a result, a party attempting to ""step into the shoes of the Canadian company"" 
must review the existing documents, subject to any confidentiality 
restrictions, in order to evaluate the positions and risks associated with 
assuming those positions.

Thus, we need to conduct a thorough due diligence of the financial trading 
positions of the Canadian company.  Please let me know if you have any 
questions.

Dear Rick:

Just a quick followup to my voice mail of earlier this afternoon---

I represent an Executive Search Firm based in Atlanta and have been retained by an international leader in the energy industry to pursue Director-level talent; as it happens, my client has recently indicated an express interest in speaking with you.  Since I'd imagine you've been inundated with calls and e-mails similar to mine, in an effort to eliminate any confusion I should tell you that we tried to contact you yesterday (my associate, Michael Allen, left you a voice mail).

I understand that the environment at Enron must be a challenging one at this point; however, if you're interested in talking/listening and are in a position to take a short break, the President/COO of my client company is in Houston today and is curious as to whether you'd by some remote chance be free this afternoon or evening for a brief chat.  I realize that this is highly unorthodox, but also feel that standing on ceremony is perhaps not always the most prudent approach.

I'll wait to hear from you in regard to your interest level---and if you're not available today (as I'm assuming to be the case), we can obviously reschedule for a time that's a bit more reasonable.  Thanks---

Sincerely,

Marcy Brinegar

Enron's Skilling Vows to Meet or Beat Profit Projections

Enron's Skilling Vows to Meet or Beat Profit Projections

     New York, July 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. will meet or
beat its profit projections this year and next, Chief Executive
Jeffrey Skilling said, criticizing analysts who've recently
lowered their forecasts for the largest energy trader.
     Enron said July 12 that it expects to make $1.80 a share this
year and $2.15 in 2002.
     ``We will hit those numbers, and we will beat those
numbers,'' Skilling told a meeting of analysts and investors in
New York.
     Enron shares have fallen about 13 percent since it made the
profit forecasts. Skilling blamed the decline on analysts who
downgraded U.S. energy companies because of falling prices for
power and natural gas.
     Analysts have also cited concern about unpaid power bills by
Enron customers in California and India, and losses by Enron's
broadband trading unit, which may hurt Enron's profits.
     ``All of these are bunk,'' Skilling said. ``These are not
issues for this stock.''
    The shares of Enron fell 96 cents to $42.33 in early afternoon
trading today.
    Enron makes much of its money from profits from arranging
trades of power, gas, oil and other commodities, Skilling said. It
returns are based more on the volume of trades and energy
contracts than on the prices of the commodities themselves, he
said.
     ``The growth of our sales is not driven by the economy,''
Skilling said. ``It's driven by the growth of markets.''
     The refusal of a state government in India to pay $64 million
in power bills is not going to hurt Enron's earnings, Skilling
said.
     ``In India, we have government guarantees on the performance
of our contract,'' Skilling said. ``We're convinced we'll be paid
in full'' for the $875 million the company has invested so far,
plus unpaid power bills. Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol Power
Co., which invested about $3 billion in a power plant in India.
    In California, Enron is owed more than the state's power grid
manager has accused the company of overcharging, Skilling said.
     California is negotiating refunds with energy traders and
generators after power prices soared in the state, leaving its two
largest utilities so far in debt they could no longer buy
electricity for their customers. The state has threatened to sue
if power sellers don't agree to $8.9 billion in refunds.
     Enron will cut its losses as it waits out a ``meltdown'' in
broadband communications, Skilling said.
     The company's plan to trade space on fiber-optic
telecommunications network helped its stock rise 87 percent last
year.
     The stock has plunged 49 percent this year as the collapse of
Internet companies darkened the outlook for broadband companies,
and natural gas prices dropped from record highs in December.
    Houston-based Enron is selling more power in Europe, and more
energy-management contracts to smaller commercial customers in the
U.S., company executives said. Energy management contracts are
agreements to buy energy for customers and find ways to cut their
energy consumption.
    Enron also is poised to profit from a Bush administration
proposal to expand competition for wholesale power, Skilling said.




USA: Enron says would not pay California refund.
By Timothy Gardner

07/25/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Energy firm Enron Corp. would not pay its ""minuscule"" portion of the nearly $9 billion California claims energy companies owe the state for overcharges during the Western power crunch, Enron President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling said on Wednesday. 
California alleges that electricity generators and marketers owe the state $8.9 billion for overcharging it during the power crisis from mid-2000 to last spring. Governor Gray Davis, a Democrat, said he is prepared to go to court to retrieve the money.
But Enron, the No. 1 U.S. natural gas and electricity marketer, does not intend to pay its portion of the alleged overcharges. which Skilling said was ""minuscule."" 
""The $9 billion number is bogus to begin with,"" Skilling told analysts at a meeting about Enron's second-quarter earnings in New York. Skilling said Enron's share of the alleged overcharge is $38.5 million. He said Enron should in fact recover $32 million in net purchases from California. 
At least one sector of California's electricity regulation system agrees that Enron's involvement was small in the power crisis, in which electricity prices reached records and rolling brownouts darkened many areas. 
Sales records kept by the California Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state's power grid, show Enron accounted for 0.4 percent of the alleged $9 billion overcharge. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is meeting on Wednesday in its biweekly commissioners meeting, in part to consider the refunds after a federal mediator rejected California's claims. On July 12. FERC Chief Administration Judge Curtis Wagner swung the issue back to the commission for further action.

Enron's Skilling Vows to Meet or Beat Profit Projections

Enron's Skilling Vows to Meet or Beat Profit Projections

     New York, July 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. will meet or
beat its profit projections this year and next, Chief Executive
Jeffrey Skilling said, criticizing analysts who've recently
lowered their forecasts for the largest energy trader.
     Enron said July 12 that it expects to make $1.80 a share this
year and $2.15 in 2002.
     ``We will hit those numbers, and we will beat those
numbers,'' Skilling told a meeting of analysts and investors in
New York.
     Enron shares have fallen about 13 percent since it made the
profit forecasts. Skilling blamed the decline on analysts who
downgraded U.S. energy companies because of falling prices for
power and natural gas.
     Analysts have also cited concern about unpaid power bills by
Enron customers in California and India, and losses by Enron's
broadband trading unit, which may hurt Enron's profits.
     ``All of these are bunk,'' Skilling said. ``These are not
issues for this stock.''
    The shares of Enron fell 96 cents to $42.33 in early afternoon
trading today.
    Enron makes much of its money from profits from arranging
trades of power, gas, oil and other commodities, Skilling said. It
returns are based more on the volume of trades and energy
contracts than on the prices of the commodities themselves, he
said.
     ``The growth of our sales is not driven by the economy,''
Skilling said. ``It's driven by the growth of markets.''
     The refusal of a state government in India to pay $64 million
in power bills is not going to hurt Enron's earnings, Skilling
said.
     ``In India, we have government guarantees on the performance
of our contract,'' Skilling said. ``We're convinced we'll be paid
in full'' for the $875 million the company has invested so far,
plus unpaid power bills. Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol Power
Co., which invested about $3 billion in a power plant in India.
    In California, Enron is owed more than the state's power grid
manager has accused the company of overcharging, Skilling said.
     California is negotiating refunds with energy traders and
generators after power prices soared in the state, leaving its two
largest utilities so far in debt they could no longer buy
electricity for their customers. The state has threatened to sue
if power sellers don't agree to $8.9 billion in refunds.
     Enron will cut its losses as it waits out a ``meltdown'' in
broadband communications, Skilling said.
     The company's plan to trade space on fiber-optic
telecommunications network helped its stock rise 87 percent last
year.
     The stock has plunged 49 percent this year as the collapse of
Internet companies darkened the outlook for broadband companies,
and natural gas prices dropped from record highs in December.
    Houston-based Enron is selling more power in Europe, and more
energy-management contracts to smaller commercial customers in the
U.S., company executives said. Energy management contracts are
agreements to buy energy for customers and find ways to cut their
energy consumption.
    Enron also is poised to profit from a Bush administration
proposal to expand competition for wholesale power, Skilling said.




USA: Enron says would not pay California refund.

NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Energy firm Enron Corp. would not pay its ""minuscule"" portion of the nearly $9 billion California claims energy companies owe the state for overcharges during the Western power crunch, Enron President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling said on Wednesday.

Dear Jeff:
 
We met at the World Economic Forum several weeks ago,  discussing Enron's interest in emissions trading, both SO2 and eventually CO2, a  subject in which I am engaged with other energy firms. I didn't get a chance to  mention that I've followed Indian energy since my posting as economic counselor  at the Delhi embassy in the mid-90's; I knew Joe Sutton quite well, as well as  many of your other folks. 
 
The news today about all the political maneuvering in regard  to Dabhol reminded me that I had wanted to offer my sympathetic and reasonably  knowledgeable support as you and your team cope with the issues, including  conciliation and a possible renegotiation. You have no scarcity of people on  this thorny subject, but I do have both a decade's perspective and excellent  current access to decisionmakers out there.

Enron's Skilling Vows to Meet or Beat Profit Projections

Enron's Skilling Vows to Meet or Beat Profit Projections

     New York, July 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. will meet or
beat its profit projections this year and next, Chief Executive
Jeffrey Skilling said, criticizing analysts who've recently
lowered their forecasts for the largest energy trader.
     Enron said July 12 that it expects to make $1.80 a share this
year and $2.15 in 2002.
     ``We will hit those numbers, and we will beat those
numbers,'' Skilling told a meeting of analysts and investors in
New York.
     Enron shares have fallen about 13 percent since it made the
profit forecasts. Skilling blamed the decline on analysts who
downgraded U.S. energy companies because of falling prices for
power and natural gas.
     Analysts have also cited concern about unpaid power bills by
Enron customers in California and India, and losses by Enron's
broadband trading unit, which may hurt Enron's profits.
     ``All of these are bunk,'' Skilling said. ``These are not
issues for this stock.''
    The shares of Enron fell 96 cents to $42.33 in early afternoon
trading today.
    Enron makes much of its money from profits from arranging
trades of power, gas, oil and other commodities, Skilling said. It
returns are based more on the volume of trades and energy
contracts than on the prices of the commodities themselves, he
said.
     ``The growth of our sales is not driven by the economy,''
Skilling said. ``It's driven by the growth of markets.''
     The refusal of a state government in India to pay $64 million
in power bills is not going to hurt Enron's earnings, Skilling
said.
     ``In India, we have government guarantees on the performance
of our contract,'' Skilling said. ``We're convinced we'll be paid
in full'' for the $875 million the company has invested so far,
plus unpaid power bills. Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol Power
Co., which invested about $3 billion in a power plant in India.
    In California, Enron is owed more than the state's power grid
manager has accused the company of overcharging, Skilling said.
     California is negotiating refunds with energy traders and
generators after power prices soared in the state, leaving its two
largest utilities so far in debt they could no longer buy
electricity for their customers. The state has threatened to sue
if power sellers don't agree to $8.9 billion in refunds.
     Enron will cut its losses as it waits out a ``meltdown'' in
broadband communications, Skilling said.
     The company's plan to trade space on fiber-optic
telecommunications network helped its stock rise 87 percent last
year.
     The stock has plunged 49 percent this year as the collapse of
Internet companies darkened the outlook for broadband companies,
and natural gas prices dropped from record highs in December.
    Houston-based Enron is selling more power in Europe, and more
energy-management contracts to smaller commercial customers in the
U.S., company executives said. Energy management contracts are
agreements to buy energy for customers and find ways to cut their
energy consumption.
    Enron also is poised to profit from a Bush administration
proposal to expand competition for wholesale power, Skilling said.




USA: Enron says would not pay California refund.
By Timothy Gardner

07/25/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Energy firm Enron Corp. would not pay its 
""minuscule"" portion of the nearly $9 billion California claims energy 
companies owe the state for overcharges during the Western power crunch, 
Enron President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling said on Wednesday. 
California alleges that electricity generators and marketers owe the state 
$8.9 billion for overcharging it during the power crisis from mid-2000 to 
last spring. Governor Gray Davis, a Democrat, said he is prepared to go to 
court to retrieve the money.
But Enron, the No. 1 U.S. natural gas and electricity marketer, does not 
intend to pay its portion of the alleged overcharges. which Skilling said was 
""minuscule."" 
""The $9 billion number is bogus to begin with,"" Skilling told analysts at a 
meeting about Enron's second-quarter earnings in New York. Skilling said 
Enron's share of the alleged overcharge is $38.5 million. He said Enron 
should in fact recover $32 million in net purchases from California. 
At least one sector of California's electricity regulation system agrees that 
Enron's involvement was small in the power crisis, in which electricity 
prices reached records and rolling brownouts darkened many areas. 
Sales records kept by the California Independent System Operator, which 
manages most of the state's power grid, show Enron accounted for 0.4 percent 
of the alleged $9 billion overcharge. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is meeting on Wednesday in its 
biweekly commissioners meeting, in part to consider the refunds after a 
federal mediator rejected California's claims. On July 12. FERC Chief 
Administration Judge Curtis Wagner swung the issue back to the commission for 
further action. Wednesday's meeting is the last scheduled before the 
commission takes a month-long break. 
STILL ROUNDS TO BE FOUGHT IN CALIFORNIA 
Enron's problems in California are far from being settled. A committee of the 
California Senate investigating suspected price gouging during the power 
crunch recently found Enron in contempt for refusing to disclose confidential 
sales and bidding records. 
The California Senate last used the contempt ruling in 1929 against a cement 
company, but eventually the state's Supreme Court threw out the ruling, 
saying the charges were too vague. 
Just before the California Senate voted to hold Enron in contempt, the 
Houston-based company sued in a California court on a claim that FERC, not 
the California Senate, had jurisdiction. 
""They (California) are making political noise we don't like,"" said Skilling. 
He said if the situation got worse the company could reduce its market share 
there. ""We'll walk away from the situation and reserve out,"" he said. 
Although Enron claims little involvement in the alleged overcharge, the 
company says it has learned from the crisis. 
Skilling said that looking forward, Enron will avoid dealing with 
intermediaries that the company contends helped lead to the power crunch. 
""We're focused on retail in California; we're going direct to customers 
without dealing with an intermediary,"" said Skilling. 
Shares in Enron, which reported earnings slightly better than expected on 
July 12, were down 34 cents to $42.90 in early trade on the New York Stock 
Exchange. That is down from its peak this year of more than $81, hit in 
mid-February in the depths of the Western power crunch.

     The refusal of a state government in India to pay $64 million
in power bills is not going to hurt Enron's earnings, Skilling
said.
     ``In India, we have government guarantees on the performance
of our contract,'' Skilling said. ``We're convinced we'll be paid
in full'' for the $875 million the company has invested so far,
plus unpaid power bills. Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol Power
Co., which invested about $3 billion in a power plant in India.
    In California, Enron is owed more than the state's power grid
manager has accused the company of overcharging, Skilling said.
     California is negotiating refunds with energy traders and
generators after power prices soared in the state, leaving its two
largest utilities so far in debt they could no longer buy
electricity for their customers. The state has threatened to sue
if power sellers don't agree to $8.9 billion in refunds.
     Enron will cut its losses as it waits out a ``meltdown'' in
broadband communications, Skilling said.
     The company's plan to trade space on fiber-optic
telecommunications network helped its stock rise 87 percent last
year.
     The stock has plunged 49 percent this year as the collapse of
Internet companies darkened the outlook for broadband companies,
and natural gas prices dropped from record highs in December.
    Houston-based Enron is selling more power in Europe, and more
energy-management contracts to smaller commercial customers in the
U.S., company executives said. Energy management contracts are
agreements to buy energy for customers and find ways to cut their
energy consumption.
    Enron also is poised to profit from a Bush administration
proposal to expand competition for wholesale power, Skilling said.




USA: Enron says would not pay California refund.
By Timothy Gardner

07/25/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Energy firm Enron Corp. would not pay its 
""minuscule"" portion of the nearly $9 billion California claims energy 
companies owe the state for overcharges during the Western power crunch, 
Enron President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling said on Wednesday. 
California alleges that electricity generators and marketers owe the state 
$8.9 billion for overcharging it during the power crisis from mid-2000 to 
last spring. Governor Gray Davis, a Democrat, said he is prepared to go to 
court to retrieve the money.
But Enron, the No. 1 U.S. natural gas and electricity marketer, does not 
intend to pay its portion of the alleged overcharges. which Skilling said was 
""minuscule."" 
""The $9 billion number is bogus to begin with,"" Skilling told analysts at a 
meeting about Enron's second-quarter earnings in New York. Skilling said 
Enron's share of the alleged overcharge is $38.5 million. He said Enron 
should in fact recover $32 million in net purchases from California. 
At least one sector of California's electricity regulation system agrees that 
Enron's involvement was small in the power crisis, in which electricity 
prices reached records and rolling brownouts darkened many areas. 
Sales records kept by the California Independent System Operator, which 
manages most of the state's power grid, show Enron accounted for 0.4 percent 
of the alleged $9 billion overcharge. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is meeting on Wednesday in its 
biweekly commissioners meeting, in part to consider the refunds after a 
federal mediator rejected California's claims. On July 12. FERC Chief 
Administration Judge Curtis Wagner swung the issue back to the commission for 
further action. Wednesday's meeting is the last scheduled before the 
commission takes a month-long break. 
STILL ROUNDS TO BE FOUGHT IN CALIFORNIA 
Enron's problems in California are far from being settled. A committee of the 
California Senate investigating suspected price gouging during the power 
crunch recently found Enron in contempt for refusing to disclose confidential 
sales and bidding records. 
The California Senate last used the contempt ruling in 1929 against a cement 
company, but eventually the state's Supreme Court threw out the ruling, 
saying the charges were too vague. 
Just before the California Senate voted to hold Enron in contempt, the 
Houston-based company sued in a California court on a claim that FERC, not 
the California Senate, had jurisdiction. 
""They (California) are making political noise we don't like,"" said Skilling. 
He said if the situation got worse the company could reduce its market share 
there. ""We'll walk away from the situation and reserve out,"" he said. 
Although Enron claims little involvement in the alleged overcharge, the 
company says it has learned from the crisis. 
Skilling said that looking forward, Enron will avoid dealing with 
intermediaries that the company contends helped lead to the power crunch. 
""We're focused on retail in California; we're going direct to customers 
without dealing with an intermediary,"" said Skilling. 
Shares in Enron, which reported earnings slightly better than expected on 
July 12, were down 34 cents to $42.90 in early trade on the New York Stock 
Exchange. That is down from its peak this year of more than $81, hit in 
mid-February in the depths of the Western power crunch.

Also, thank you for taking time to do the Intern orientation yesterday, I really appreciate your involvement.

P.S. If you see Ken, tell him he doesn't have to worry about sharing the cell with Spike.  I hear guys with tattoos are afraid of the dark.  Those were the most irresponsible comments I've ever heard from a public official.

We are now reviewing Information Memoranda on some Reliant Energy assets and 
must respond with a non-binding indication of interest by 5:00 PM, March 15.  
If we are selected to go on to the next phase of the process, we will be 
scheduled for a 2 day data room visit.  These sessions will begin on or about 
March 20.  It is a fairly fast track deal.  REI wants binding offers by April 
20, with final execution of a definitive agreement in late April/early May.

The assets are being offered either as a total package, or in any subset(s), 
broken down as follows:
 Reliant Energy Gas Transmission and Mississippi River Transmission  (to be 
viewed together as a single asset)
 Reliant Energy Field Services (gathering and processing)
 Reliant Energy Arkla (LDC)
 Reliant Energy Minnegasco (LDC)

We will need to find a solution to the PUHCA problem if we seriously want to 
buy either the Minnegasco or Arkla LDC assets (this could be very 
difficult).  The transmission and the field service assets would be ""easier"" 
to own from that standpoint.  In any event, we may want to go to all the data 
rooms just to learn about these assets.

Bottom line, if our preliminary bids are good enough to get into the data 
room phase of this deal, we will need a lot of help from the operations 
side.  These assets start with field gathering & processing, and end with 
retail gas deliveries to the homeowner ... truly a ""stem to stern"" asset 
package.  I'll keep you up to date on our progress, but we should be thinking 
about the team we'd put in the data room, and on site visits, etc. if given 
the opportunity.

Enron's Skilling Vows to Meet or Beat Profit Projections

Enron's Skilling Vows to Meet or Beat Profit Projections

     New York, July 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. will meet or
beat its profit projections this year and next, Chief Executive
Jeffrey Skilling said, criticizing analysts who've recently
lowered their forecasts for the largest energy trader.
     Enron said July 12 that it expects to make $1.80 a share this
year and $2.15 in 2002.
     ``We will hit those numbers, and we will beat those
numbers,'' Skilling told a meeting of analysts and investors in
New York.
     Enron shares have fallen about 13 percent since it made the
profit forecasts. Skilling blamed the decline on analysts who
downgraded U.S. energy companies because of falling prices for
power and natural gas.
     Analysts have also cited concern about unpaid power bills by
Enron customers in California and India, and losses by Enron's
broadband trading unit, which may hurt Enron's profits.
     ``All of these are bunk,'' Skilling said. ``These are not
issues for this stock.''
    The shares of Enron fell 96 cents to $42.33 in early afternoon
trading today.
    Enron makes much of its money from profits from arranging
trades of power, gas, oil and other commodities, Skilling said. It
returns are based more on the volume of trades and energy
contracts than on the prices of the commodities themselves, he
said.
     ``The growth of our sales is not driven by the economy,''
Skilling said. ``It's driven by the growth of markets.''
     The refusal of a state government in India to pay $64 million
in power bills is not going to hurt Enron's earnings, Skilling
said.
     ``In India, we have government guarantees on the performance
of our contract,'' Skilling said. ``We're convinced we'll be paid
in full'' for the $875 million the company has invested so far,
plus unpaid power bills. Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol Power
Co., which invested about $3 billion in a power plant in India.
    In California, Enron is owed more than the state's power grid
manager has accused the company of overcharging, Skilling said.
     California is negotiating refunds with energy traders and
generators after power prices soared in the state, leaving its two
largest utilities so far in debt they could no longer buy
electricity for their customers. The state has threatened to sue
if power sellers don't agree to $8.9 billion in refunds.
     Enron will cut its losses as it waits out a ``meltdown'' in
broadband communications, Skilling said.
     The company's plan to trade space on fiber-optic
telecommunications network helped its stock rise 87 percent last
year.
     The stock has plunged 49 percent this year as the collapse of
Internet companies darkened the outlook for broadband companies,
and natural gas prices dropped from record highs in December.
    Houston-based Enron is selling more power in Europe, and more
energy-management contracts to smaller commercial customers in the
U.S., company executives said. Energy management contracts are
agreements to buy energy for customers and find ways to cut their
energy consumption.
    Enron also is poised to profit from a Bush administration
proposal to expand competition for wholesale power, Skilling said.




USA: Enron says would not pay California refund.
By Timothy Gardner

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Energy firm Enron Corp. would not pay its 
""minuscule"" portion of the nearly $9 billion California claims energy 
companies owe the state for overcharges during the Western power crunch, 
Enron President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling said on Wednesday. 
California alleges that electricity generators and marketers owe the state 
$8.9 billion for overcharging it during the power crisis from mid-2000 to 
last spring. Governor Gray Davis, a Democrat, said he is prepared to go to 
court to retrieve the money.
But Enron, the No. 1 U.S. natural gas and electricity marketer, does not 
intend to pay its portion of the alleged overcharges. which Skilling said was 
""minuscule."" 
""The $9 billion number is bogus to begin with,"" Skilling told analysts at a 
meeting about Enron's second-quarter earnings in New York. Skilling said 
Enron's share of the alleged overcharge is $38.5 million. He said Enron 
should in fact recover $32 million in net purchases from California. 
At least one sector of California's electricity regulation system agrees that 
Enron's involvement was small in the power crisis, in which electricity 
prices reached records and rolling brownouts darkened many areas. 
Sales records kept by the California Independent System Operator, which 
manages most of the state's power grid, show Enron accounted for 0.4 percent 
of the alleged $9 billion overcharge. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is meeting on Wednesday in its 
biweekly commissioners meeting, in part to consider the refunds after a 
federal mediator rejected California's claims. On July 12. FERC Chief 
Administration Judge Curtis Wagner swung the issue back to the commission for 
further action. Wednesday's meeting is the last scheduled before the 
commission takes a month-long break. 
STILL ROUNDS TO BE FOUGHT IN CALIFORNIA 
Enron's problems in California are far from being settled. A committee of the 
California Senate investigating suspected price gouging during the power 
crunch recently found Enron in contempt for refusing to disclose confidential 
sales and bidding records. 
The California Senate last used the contempt ruling in 1929 against a cement 
company, but eventually the state's Supreme Court threw out the ruling, 
saying the charges were too vague. 
Just before the California Senate voted to hold Enron in contempt, the 
Houston-based company sued in a California court on a claim that FERC, not 
the California Senate, had jurisdiction. 
""They (California) are making political noise we don't like,"" said Skilling. 
He said if the situation got worse the company could reduce its market share 
there. ""We'll walk away from the situation and reserve out,"" he said. 
Although Enron claims little involvement in the alleged overcharge, the 
company says it has learned from the crisis. 
Skilling said that looking forward, Enron will avoid dealing with 
intermediaries that the company contends helped lead to the power crunch. 
""We're focused on retail in California; we're going direct to customers 
without dealing with an intermediary,"" said Skilling. 
Shares in Enron, which reported earnings slightly better than expected on 
July 12, were down 34 cents to $42.90 in early trade on the New York Stock 
Exchange. That is down from its peak this year of more than $81, hit in 
mid-February in the depths of the Western power crunch.

Lisa,

Paul asked that I relay the contractual information for developing the
Edwards AFB Parker-Davis hourly schedule for April that will need to be
completed no later than COB Thursday, March 28.  

Contract Rate of Delivery for April = 18,285 kW
Firm Electric Service = 8,809,000 kWh (Energy Accounting Line # 4782)
Non-Firm Interuptable Service = 0 kWh (Energy Accounting Line # 4783)
Minimum Off-Peak Firm Electric Service = 4,571 kW
Minimum Off-Peak Firm Electric Service Energy = 1,389,660 kWh

I've attached a Firm Electric Service Schedule that would meet the
above contractual requirements for your review.

Please contact me at (602) 352-2678 or lgarrett@wapa.gov if you have
questions.  Once you have the hourly Parker-Davis Firm Electric Service
schedule prepared please forward to CBristow@wapa.gov and
presched@sce.com and myself.  Thank.

Elizabeth, in Mark's legal conference call this morning you updated your 
meeting in Toronto.  Gaffney spoke to me last week after the meeting and his 
summary was in essence the same as yours.  My thoughts which I passed along 
to Chris were:

1.  I do not agree with OPGI's contention that the Ontario market will be 
financial only.  I have crossed this issue a number of times in Ontario, and 
believe that this assertion is ill-conceived and would not be agreed to by 
those familiar with the developing market rules.  Most notably, Aleck Dadson 
of the Government Affairs group in Toronto knows the market rules as they 
currently stand as well as any one in the market, and Rob Milnthorp is on the 
Board of the IMO.  Both would, I believe, agree that there is a distinction 
as to how the IMO-controlled market will operate and physical bilateral OTC 
contracting.  Operationally, the IMO-controlled market will be set up as a 
pool mechanism where physical bilats are permitted and indeed contemplated, 
but if there are deficiencies in physical delivery/receipt obligations those 
will be settled through the pool.  This does not mean, however, that, in 
terms of legal obligations, there is not a physical delivery obligation and 
all that goes with it (such as force majeure, etc).  Nor is the settlement in 
the pool costless to the non-defaulting party (prudential requirements, 
etc).  To the extent that a party wants to rely on the pool to settle the 
deficiencies, and subject to issues such as compensating the non-defaulting 
party for any increased prudentials and other associated costs, there is 
still a physical bilat and the party with the delivery obligation can rely, 
if it chooses, on the contractula obligation to deliver ""or cause to be 
delivered"" the energy.  In other words, I distinguish how the pool operates 
from the nature of the legal obligations.

2.  I think the issue of force majeure needs to be reconsidered along the 
lines originally proposed by Greg.  For pool level deliveries, whether in gas 
or in power, we (Canada) have always restricted force majeure to failure of 
the pool if it affects everyone transacting at the pool.  This is the type of 
force majeure we use for ""NIT"" or ""Hub"" delivery obligations in gas, and is 
the type of force majeure Greg envisioned for the Alberta Power Pool and the 
IMO-Controlled Grid. This type of force majeure eliminates force majeure risk 
from our portfolio, as we therefore are never long or short as a result of 
force majeure.  If we are transacting at a point outside of the pool, that 
will be the exception and not the rule, and should be dealt with specifically 
in the transaction Confirm.  This is how we handle our gas business as set up 
by Lavorato.

3.  Aleck Dadson should attend the next meeting (if not all meetings) with 
Chris to answer to any market rule issues.

4.  Please involve Greg in your discusions on the form of Master that is 
developed.

or in power, we (Canada) have always restricted force majeure to failure of 
the pool if it affects everyone transacting at the pool.  This is the type of 
force majeure we use for ""NIT"" or ""Hub"" delivery obligations in gas, and is 
the type of force majeure Greg envisioned for the Alberta Power Pool and the 
IMO-Controlled Grid. This type of force majeure eliminates force majeure risk 
from our portfolio, as we therefore are never long or short as a result of 
force majeure.  If we are transacting at a point outside of the pool, that 
will be the exception and not the rule, and should be dealt with specifically 
in the transaction Confirm.  This is how we handle our gas business as set up 
by Lavorato.

3.  Aleck Dadson should attend the next meeting (if not all meetings) with 
Chris to answer to any market rule issues.

4.  Please involve Greg in your discusions on the form of Master that is 
developed.

Peter.",Ontario Master Project,peter.keohane@enron.com,"Elizabeth, in Mark's legal conference call this morning you updated your 
meeting in Toronto.  Gaffney spoke to me last week after the meeting and his 
summary was in essence the same as yours.  My thoughts which I passed along 
to Chris were:

1.  I do not agree with OPGI's contention that the Ontario market will be 
financial only.  I have crossed this issue a number of times in Ontario, and 
believe that this assertion is ill-conceived and would not be agreed to by 
those familiar with the developing market rules.  Most notably, Aleck Dadson 
of the Government Affairs group in Toronto knows the market rules as they 
currently stand as well as any one in the market, and Rob Milnthorp is on the 
Board of the IMO.  Both would, I believe, agree that there is a distinction 
as to how the IMO-controlled market will operate and physical bilateral OTC 
contracting.  Operationally, the IMO-controlled market will be set up as a 
pool mechanism where physical bilats are permitted and indeed contemplated, 
but if there are deficiencies in physical delivery/receipt obligations those 
will be settled through the pool.  This does not mean, however, that, in 
terms of legal obligations, there is not a physical delivery obligation and 
all that goes with it (such as force majeure, etc).  Nor is the settlement in 
the pool costless to the non-defaulting party (prudential requirements, 
etc).  To the extent that a party wants to rely on the pool to settle the 
deficiencies, and subject to issues such as compensating the non-defaulting 
party for any increased prudentials and other associated costs, there is 
still a physical bilat and the party with the delivery obligation can rely, 
if it chooses, on the contractula obligation to deliver ""or cause to be 
delivered"" the energy.  In other words, I distinguish how the pool operates 
from the nature of the legal obligations.

2.  I think the issue of force majeure needs to be reconsidered along the 
lines originally proposed by Greg.  For pool level deliveries, whether in gas 
or in power, we (Canada) have always restricted force majeure to failure of 
the pool if it affects everyone transacting at the pool.  This is the type of 
force majeure we use for ""NIT"" or ""Hub"" delivery obligations in gas, and is 
the type of force majeure Greg envisioned for the Alberta Power Pool and the 
IMO-Controlled Grid. This type of force majeure eliminates force majeure risk 
from our portfolio, as we therefore are never long or short as a result of

will be the exception and not the rule, and should be dealt with specifically 
in the transaction Confirm.  This is how we handle our gas business as set up 
by Lavorato.

Also, thank you for taking time to do the Intern orientation yesterday, I really appreciate your involvement.

P.S. If you see Ken, tell him he doesn't have to worry about sharing the cell with Spike.  I hear guys with tattoos are afraid of the dark.  Those were the most irresponsible comments I've ever heard from a public official.

1)	Travel Limitations - Is there an unspoken move to limit travel and business expenditures?  Is this business smart (as I currently manage) or specific to Enron's current status?

2)	Strategic Asset Development - I currently have no employees committed to this group, yet my prior group is transitioning to Frank.  Do I have the continued authority to build a business which includes new employees,  new infrastructure, etc.?  If I need to wait for some specific timeline (5 - 10 days), please give me a nod.

Gentlemen, the attached MHI response #2 provides their answer to the Enron question of the maximum allowable ash content in the fuel oil supply.

At this stage we will have to assume that this is definitely their final answer to the ash content issue.

 SUBJ.: Ash Content in Fuel Oil

Gentlemen, the attached MHI response #2 provides their answer to the Enron question of the maximum allowable ash content in the fuel oil supply.

At this stage we will have to assume that this is definitely their final answer to the ash content issue.

Thanks,
Frank

Hi Gang, 

In getting ready for vacation, I've fallen behind on my phone calls.  Therefore, I'm sending an email.

As Steve may have told you by now, you do have authorization to file the intervention in the CC lawsuit and join in the Motion to Dismiss.  Once we see how that goes, we will discuss strategy and further activities.

Debbie, I will try to call you tomorrow am so that we can discuss the moratorium issues and get at least a short term game plan.  It will be before noon central, as I'm on the plane at that point.

Ben, Steve and I have had a couple of discussions, and we have agreed that on a going forward basis, I will need to be involved in all strategy decisions and decisions impacting our legal fees.  Obviously, this does not go to the point of needing permission to handle to routine matters, but does involve needing approval before engaging in legal research, preparing motions and conducting discovery.  It is Enron's policy to enforce this by disallowing any fees and expenses not approved in advance.  I know it sounds harsh, but I believe it is workable given the team we have working for us.  

I would be glad to hear any suggestions you might have regarding cost containment.

Again, pardon the abruptness of this email, but I want to get the info to you as soon as possible.  We appreciate your efforts on behalf of Enron, and look forward to our mutual success.

EIA Rolls Out Long List of New Gas-Fired Power 
Between 2000 and 2004, a total of 145,417 MW of nonutility generation is 
expected to be added to the U.S. power grid and 83% of that total will be 
gas-fired power generation, according to a new survey by the Energy 
Information Administration. 

The EIA's Inventory of Nonutility Electric Power Plants in the United States 
find that a total of 799 new gas-fired units, totaling 120,645 MW in 
nameplate capacity, are scheduled to be added by the end of 2004.  The 
Southeastern Electric Reliability Council is expected to receive the largest 
portion of new nonutility generation with an additional 252 units totaling 
36,636 MW.  SERC is followed by ERCOT with 109 new units totaling 21,775 MW, 
ECAR with an expected 181 additional units totaling 17,733 MW and MAIN with 
140 new units totaling 17,139 MW. 

The largest amount of new nonutility capacity, or about 61,823 MW, is 
expected to be added in 2002.  About 46,551 MW of new capacity is scheduled 
to be in service next year. 

Electric restructuring has led to a boom in nonutility power generation.  The 
EIA report found that total nonutility generation in 1999 reached 167,357 MW, 
which was a 71% increase from the previous year.  However, only 21% of the 
total represented new plants.  In 1999, about 50,000 MW of electric utility 
generation assets were purchased by nonutility generation companies.  At the 
end of 1999, nonutility generation accounted for 19.8% of total electric 
generation in the country.  The totals reported by EIA include all operable 
units, even those that did not run at all in 1999 but are expected to return 
to service. 

Gas-fired power accounted for the largest share of nonutility generation last 
year, and the Pacific Census Division accounted for 31.4% of that gas-fired 
capacity. The Pacific Census Division also accounted for the greatest number 
(1,167) of total nonutility generation and the most nonutility capacity 
(33,254 MW). California was the dominant state in the division with 30,189 
MW. 

Gas-fired (only) generation represented 29.4% (49,353 MW) of total nonutility 
capacity in 1999, and petroleum/natural gas (fuel switchable/combined) 
generation accounted for 24.2% (40,508 MW) of the total. Coal represented 
28.9% (48,501 MW).  Hydroelectric power accounted for 3.6%. Petroleum (only) 
totaled 2.2% and all other sources amounted to 11.5% of total nonutility 
generation. 

The top five states based on existing nameplate capacity are California 
(30,189 MW), Illinois (24,013 MW), New York (17,256 MW), Pennsylvania (12,483 
MW) and Texas (12,376 MW).

Due to recent events, mixed messages are permeating on what is appropriate business protocol.  Specific to my activities I need the following clarification:

1)	Travel Limitations - Is there an unspoken move to limit travel and business expenditures?  Is this business smart (as I currently manage) or specific to Enron's current status?

2)	Strategic Asset Development - I currently have no employees committed to this group, yet my prior group is transitioning to Frank.  Do I have the continued authority to build a business which includes new employees,  new infrastructure, etc.?  If I need to wait for some specific timeline (5 - 10 days), please give me a nod.  Especially during this time, I need to be busy/head down/about business... 

I would appreciate your response.

Chris,

The System Test environment has not been available this morning for a couple
of reasons.  During the code migration code last evening which resolved the
problem of Power Prices not displaying correctly, an unrelated problem arose
with one of the application controls that handles some of the grid display
features.  During one of the comipiles the .dll was corrupted.  This has
required us to rebuild the control and update the entire application to
reference the newly rebuilt contol's class id.  Although the Power products
have been active since last night, we have been unable to bring the system
test environment on-line for testing because of the corrupted application
control.  We anticipate that the system will be back up within the next
hour, by 2pm (barring any other unforeseen problems).  We apologize for any
inconvenience that we've caused for the Enron testing effort this morning.

To address Enron's concerns expressed to you during this morning's
conference call, here is what we are currently doing in each of these areas:

Performance of the system - We believe we know exactly what is causing the
performance problem.  However, the person that is best qualified to resolve
that problem has been extremely busy addressing other issues, such as
verifying that the integrity of the data and messages that are sent back and
forth are accurate.  This person will spend the majority of today and
tomorrow fine-tuning performance.  We have a very high degree of confidence
that we can improve performance in short order to the level that is
acceptable to Enron.

Power Prices - We observed some problems with the Power filters and took
these products offline yesterday so that we could work on the problem.  We
believe the problem has been resolved and have migrated the code to System
Test.  Although Power Prices are available right now, the System Test
environment is offline right now due to code migrations unrelated to the
power issue.

Notification of Failed Transactions - The concern is that when a user's
order results in an attempted transaction against EOL and a Failure message
is received from Enron, the True Quote system does not display a message to
the user explaining that Counterparty was not available to fill the order.
We have analysts working on the notification messages right now.  If a
user's order is submitted with a duration of 'Fill or Kill' and the order is
not filled at least partially, we plan to push a message notification to the
user stating the following:  ""Your order was received by the system;
however, no counterparties were available to fill your request"".  We may
also display a 'small print' disclaimer at the bottom of the message that
says:  *Orders may not be filled due to unavailable volume, credit
limitations, or another platform particpant acquiring the volume slightly
ahead of your order request.""  The wording of this message is pending
approval by True Quote executive management.    These changes will be
migrated to System Test this weekend.

Stress Testing - We are also concerned with the lack of stress testing that
we have been able to perform and have been concerned with amount of
realistic functionality testing that can be accomplished given the
compressed testing timeframe.  True Quote is dedicated to completing as much
functional testing and performance tuning as possible and will have our
entire team here all weekend to press forward with these efforts.  It was
our understanding that Enron and True Quote management had decided to forego
stress testing in order to take this system into production by March 12.  We
have assumed and planned for more rigorous stress testing using the System
Test environment AFTER March 12 to improve performance over the coming
weeks.  If management has now decided that a thorough and complete system
wide stress test is a pre-production requirement, then we agree that March
12 is not a realistic Go-Live date.

Yesterday, we received several errors from EOL when we attempted to login
and when we attempted to execute transactions.  The following is a list of
errors that we received throughout the day:

9:07 a.m. to 9:10 a.m.	Received three ""Internal Server Error - Unable to
process request"" messages
12:10 a.m.		Received three ""Internal Server Error - Unable to process
request"" messages
12:13 a.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with ""Failure: Broker user's session
invalid"" message
12:14 a.m.		Receved ""A connection with the server could not be established""
message
12:15 a.m.		Received ""Failure msg = User not found in session"" Code = ""Bus""
message
12:25 a.m. 		Received ""Internal Server Error - Unable to process request""
message
2:43 p.m.		Received two Attempt Transactions failed with ""Failure: Broker
user's session invalid"" messages
2:51 p.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with ""Failure: Broker user's session
invalid"" message
3:06 p.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with ""Failure: Broker user's session
invalid"" message
4:47 p.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with ""Counterparty has no offer access
to product"" message

We are concerned about the stability of the Enron servers.  Could you please
ask Bob in investigate why we are getting these types of errors throughout
the day?  We are also concerned that the process for verifying the status of
a transaction that has not completed in a reasonable amount of time is not
yet in place at Enron.  We see this as a critical process that must be in
place and working before we go live.  In addition, we have experienced
things like receiving messages that we had not anticipated, receiving random
credit updates that we thought we had agree that we would not receive, and
changes in XML attributes and content that we had not seen in previous
testing.

We are working very hard to address issues as quickly as we can and
appreciate very much having Matt Mottsinger addressing issues on Enron's
side as quickly as possible.  We will take their offer on using Matt to a
higher degree.  If it makes sense for him to be here at our site this
weekend, than we are happy to find him place to work in our environment, but
if it makes more sense to have him available from Enron's location, we can
stay in contact with him via telephone.
